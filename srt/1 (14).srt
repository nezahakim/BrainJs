1
00:00:48,300 --> 00:00:51,300
I believe in America.

2
00:00:51,300 --> 00:00:54,300
America has made my fortune.

3
00:00:54,300 --> 00:00:58,300
And I raised my daughter
in the American fashion.

4
00:00:58,500 --> 00:01:03,300
I gave her freedom, but I taught her
never to dishonour her family.

5
00:01:04,700 --> 00:01:08,000
She found a boyfriend, not an Italian.

6
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:12,600
She went to the movies with him.
She stayed out late.

7
00:01:12,600 --> 00:01:14,300
I didn't protest.

8
00:01:15,300 --> 00:01:20,000
Two months ago he took her for a drive
with another boyfriend.

9
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:23,800
They made her drink whiskey

10
00:01:23,800 --> 00:01:28,200
and then they tried to
take advantage of her.

11
00:01:28,200 --> 00:01:32,500
She resisted, she kept her honour.

12
00:01:33,600 --> 00:01:37,400
So they beat her like an animal.

13
00:01:38,600 --> 00:01:43,600
When I went to the hospital,
her nose was broken,

14
00:01:43,600 --> 00:01:48,400
her jaw was shattered,
held together by wire.

15
00:01:50,200 --> 00:01:53,600
She couldn't even weep
because of the pain.

16
00:01:55,700 --> 00:01:59,300
But I wept. Why did I weep?

17
00:02:01,800 --> 00:02:04,600
She was the light of my life.

18
00:02:06,200 --> 00:02:07,900
Beautiful girl.

19
00:02:11,700 --> 00:02:14,600
Now she will never be beautiful again.

20
00:02:21,200 --> 00:02:23,200
Sorry.

21
00:02:30,800 --> 00:02:35,500
I went to the police,
like a good American.

22
00:02:35,500 --> 00:02:38,200
These two boys were brought to trial.

23
00:02:39,300 --> 00:02:44,400
The judge sentenced them to three years
in prison, but suspended the sentence.

24
00:02:45,400 --> 00:02:50,700
Suspended the sentence!
They went free that very day!

25
00:02:52,800 --> 00:02:56,200
I stood in the courtroom like a fool.

26
00:02:56,200 --> 00:02:59,900
Those two bastards, they smiled at me.

27
00:03:00,900 --> 00:03:06,900
Then I said to my wife, "For justice,
we must go to Don Corleone."

28
00:03:11,900 --> 00:03:16,300
Why did you go to the police?
Why didn't you come to me first?

29
00:03:16,300 --> 00:03:22,600
What do you want of me? Tell me
anything, but do what I beg you to do.

30
00:03:22,600 --> 00:03:24,200
What is that?

31
00:03:35,200 --> 00:03:37,000
I want them dead.

32
00:03:48,900 --> 00:03:50,200
That I cannot do.

33
00:03:51,900 --> 00:03:54,400
I'll give you anything you ask.

34
00:03:56,800 --> 00:04:02,300
I've known you many years, but this
is the first time you've asked for help.

35
00:04:03,400 --> 00:04:08,700
I can't remember the last time
you invited me for a cup of coffee.

36
00:04:09,800 --> 00:04:13,600
Even though my wife is godmother
to your only child.

37
00:04:13,600 --> 00:04:18,700
But let's be frank here.
You never wanted my friendship.

38
00:04:18,700 --> 00:04:22,500
And you were afraid to be in my debt.

39
00:04:22,500 --> 00:04:25,000
I didn't want to get into trouble.

40
00:04:26,100 --> 00:04:29,000
I understand.

41
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:31,900
You found Paradise in America.

42
00:04:34,200 --> 00:04:39,100
You made a good living, had police
protection and there were courts of law.

43
00:04:39,100 --> 00:04:41,800
You didn't need a friend like me.

44
00:04:43,500 --> 00:04:47,100
But now you come to me and say,

45
00:04:47,100 --> 00:04:49,900
"Don Corleone, give me justice."

46
00:04:51,300 --> 00:04:54,300
But you don't ask with respect.

47
00:04:54,300 --> 00:04:59,800
You don't offer friendship. You don't
even think to call me Godfather.

48
00:05:00,800 --> 00:05:07,900
You come on my daughter's wedding
day and ask me to murder for money.

49
00:05:07,900 --> 00:05:10,500
I ask you for justice.

50
00:05:10,500 --> 00:05:13,300
That is not justice.
Your daughter is alive.

51
00:05:14,400 --> 00:05:18,300
Let them suffer, then, as she suffers.

52
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:22,300
How much shall I pay you?

53
00:05:36,900 --> 00:05:40,900
Bonasera, Bonasera.

54
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:45,000
What have I ever done to make you
treat me so disrespectfully?

55
00:05:46,100 --> 00:05:48,900
If you'd come in friendship,

56
00:05:48,900 --> 00:05:53,300
the scum that ruined your daughter
would be suffering this very day.

57
00:05:54,400 --> 00:05:59,700
And if an honest man like you should
make enemies, they'd be my enemies.

58
00:06:02,500 --> 00:06:05,400
And then they would fear you.

59
00:06:08,900 --> 00:06:11,000
Be my friend?

60
00:06:14,900 --> 00:06:16,900
Godfather?

61
00:06:20,900 --> 00:06:22,100
Good.

62
00:06:24,100 --> 00:06:29,300
Some day, and that day may never
come, I'll ask a service of you.

63
00:06:30,700 --> 00:06:32,900
But until that day...

64
00:06:34,500 --> 00:06:38,900
...accept this justice as a gift
on my daughter's wedding day.

65
00:06:38,900 --> 00:06:41,500
- Grazie, Godfather.
- Prego.

66
00:06:48,500 --> 00:06:51,500
Give this to Clemenza.

67
00:06:53,500 --> 00:06:57,100
I want people that aren't going to
get carried away.

68
00:06:57,100 --> 00:07:01,100
We're not murderers,
in spite of what this undertaker says.

69
00:07:26,500 --> 00:07:30,000
- Where's Michael?
- Don't worry, he'll be here.

70
00:07:31,200 --> 00:07:33,900
We're not taking the picture
without Michael.

71
00:07:40,500 --> 00:07:43,200
- What's the matter?
- It's Michael.

72
00:08:32,600 --> 00:08:34,300
Don Barzini.

73
00:08:50,800 --> 00:08:54,100
Hey, Paulie! Let me have some wine.

74
00:08:54,100 --> 00:08:56,300
Paulie! More wine.

75
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:03,600
- You look terrific on the floor.
- Are you a dance judge or something?

76
00:09:03,600 --> 00:09:05,600
Take a walk and do your job.

77
00:09:13,400 --> 00:09:16,800
Sandra, watch the kids.
Don't let them run wild.

78
00:09:16,800 --> 00:09:19,800
You watch yourself, all right?

79
00:09:40,500 --> 00:09:44,500
20, 30 grand. In small bills, cash.

80
00:09:45,600 --> 00:09:47,900
In that little silk purse.

81
00:09:47,900 --> 00:09:51,800
If this were somebody else's wedding...
Sfortunato!

82
00:09:51,800 --> 00:09:54,200
Hey, Paulie!

83
00:09:56,900 --> 00:09:58,100
Stupid jerk!

84
00:10:07,100 --> 00:10:09,100
What's the matter?

85
00:10:21,500 --> 00:10:24,000
- Have to go back to work.
- Tom.

86
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:28,000
No Sicilian can refuse any request
on his daughter's wedding day.

87
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:39,100
Don Corleone, I'm honoured and
grateful that you have invited me.

88
00:10:43,500 --> 00:10:47,200
Get out of here!
It's a private party. Go on!

89
00:10:48,200 --> 00:10:51,200
What is it? It's my sister's wedding.

90
00:10:57,800 --> 00:11:01,100
Goddamn FBI don't respect nothing!

91
00:11:03,500 --> 00:11:06,100
Come here, come here, come here!

92
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:25,800
...but towards the end, he was paroled
to help with the American war effort,

93
00:11:25,800 --> 00:11:28,900
so for six months he's worked
in my pastry shop.

94
00:11:28,900 --> 00:11:31,800
Nazorine, what can I do for you?

95
00:11:31,800 --> 00:11:33,800
Now that the war is over,

96
00:11:33,800 --> 00:11:37,800
this boy, Enzo, they want to
repatriate him back to Italy.

97
00:11:37,900 --> 00:11:42,900
Godfather, I have a daughter.
You see, she and Enzo...

98
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:48,500
You want Enzo to stay in this country,
and your daughter to be married.

99
00:11:49,600 --> 00:11:51,900
You understand everything.

100
00:11:52,800 --> 00:11:55,100
Mr. Hagen. Thank you.

101
00:11:58,500 --> 00:12:02,400
Wait till you see the wedding cake
I made for your daughter!

102
00:12:02,400 --> 00:12:05,100
The bride, the groom and the angel...

103
00:12:10,300 --> 00:12:14,900
- Who should I give this job to?
- Not to our paisà.

104
00:12:14,900 --> 00:12:20,200
Give it to a Jew Congressman in
another district. Who else is on the list?

105
00:12:27,200 --> 00:12:28,800
Hey, Michael!

106
00:12:48,600 --> 00:12:52,000
He's not on the list,
but Luca Brasi wants to see you.

107
00:12:57,800 --> 00:13:00,300
Is this necessary?

108
00:13:00,300 --> 00:13:04,800
He didn't expect to be invited to the
wedding, so he wanted to thank you.

109
00:13:06,300 --> 00:13:12,100
Don Corleone, I'm honoured and
grateful that you have invited me

110
00:13:12,100 --> 00:13:17,300
on the wedding day of your daughter.
May their first child be a masculine child.

111
00:13:18,400 --> 00:13:19,800
Michael...

112
00:13:21,600 --> 00:13:24,900
That man over there
is talking to himself.

113
00:13:24,900 --> 00:13:28,100
See that scary guy over there?

114
00:13:28,100 --> 00:13:31,700
- He's a very scary guy.
- What's his name?

115
00:13:31,700 --> 00:13:36,100
His name is Luca Brasi.
He helps my father out sometimes.

116
00:13:37,500 --> 00:13:40,400
Michael, he's coming over here!

117
00:13:45,200 --> 00:13:47,200
You look terrific!

118
00:13:47,200 --> 00:13:50,500
My brother Tom Hagen,
Miss Kay Adams.

119
00:13:52,100 --> 00:13:54,500
Your father's been asking for you.

120
00:13:54,500 --> 00:13:57,400
- Very nice to meet you.
- Nice to meet you.

121
00:13:59,200 --> 00:14:01,900
Why does your brother
have a different name?

122
00:14:01,900 --> 00:14:05,700
My brother Sonny found Tom Hagen
in the street.

123
00:14:05,700 --> 00:14:10,300
He had no home,
so my father took him in.

124
00:14:11,600 --> 00:14:14,600
He's been with us ever since.

125
00:14:14,600 --> 00:14:16,600
He's a good lawyer.

126
00:14:17,600 --> 00:14:22,200
Not a Sicilian. I think he's
going to be consigliere.

127
00:14:22,200 --> 00:14:25,300
- What's that?
- That's a...

128
00:14:25,300 --> 00:14:28,900
...like a counsellor, an advisor.
Very important for the family.

129
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:32,100
You like your lasagne?

130
00:14:36,500 --> 00:14:38,800
Don Corleone.

131
00:14:38,800 --> 00:14:41,400
I'm honoured and grateful

132
00:14:41,400 --> 00:14:45,400
that you have invited me
to your daughter's wedding.

133
00:14:50,300 --> 00:14:53,600
On the day of your daughter's wedding.

134
00:14:53,600 --> 00:14:58,900
And I hope that their first child
will be a masculine child.

135
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:05,400
I pledge my ever-ending loyalty.

136
00:15:07,100 --> 00:15:12,000
- For your daughter's bridal purse.
- Thank you, Luca. Most valued friend.

137
00:15:12,500 --> 00:15:17,700
Don Corleone, I'm going to leave you
now, because I know you're busy.

138
00:15:18,200 --> 00:15:19,600
Thank you.

139
00:16:09,200 --> 00:16:11,700
Signora Corleone!

140
00:16:11,700 --> 00:16:13,800
No!

141
00:17:24,600 --> 00:17:29,700
Senator Cauley apologised for not
coming, but said you'd understand.

142
00:17:29,700 --> 00:17:34,000
Also some of the judges.
They've all sent gifts.

143
00:17:37,000 --> 00:17:38,300
What is that outside?

144
00:17:47,400 --> 00:17:50,300
Johnny! Johnny!

145
00:17:53,000 --> 00:17:54,600
I love you!

146
00:18:04,800 --> 00:18:08,400
He came all the way from California.
I told you he'd come!

147
00:18:08,400 --> 00:18:11,900
- He's probably in trouble again.
- He's a good godson.

148
00:18:12,800 --> 00:18:17,400
Johnny, Johnny! Sing a song!

149
00:18:32,800 --> 00:18:35,800
You never said you knew
Johnny Fontane!

150
00:18:35,800 --> 00:18:39,800
- Sure. You want to meet him?
- Great! Sure.

151
00:18:39,900 --> 00:18:43,900
- My father helped him with his career.
- He did?

152
00:18:43,900 --> 00:18:45,000
How?

153
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:49,400
- Let's listen to this song.
- Michael...

154
00:19:23,500 --> 00:19:25,700
Please, Michael. Tell me.

155
00:19:29,500 --> 00:19:34,500
When Johnny was starting out, he was
signed to a personal service contract

156
00:19:34,500 --> 00:19:37,400
with a big bandleader.

157
00:19:37,400 --> 00:19:42,700
And as his career got better and better,
he wanted to get out of it.

158
00:19:42,700 --> 00:19:45,300
Johnny is my father's godson.

159
00:19:45,300 --> 00:19:48,900
My father went to see this bandleader.

160
00:19:48,900 --> 00:19:52,900
He offered him 10,000 dollars
to let Johnny go,

161
00:19:52,900 --> 00:19:55,700
but the bandleader said no.

162
00:19:55,700 --> 00:20:01,000
So the next day my father went to see
him, but this time with Luca Brasi.

163
00:20:03,000 --> 00:20:05,300
Within an hour,

164
00:20:05,300 --> 00:20:11,100
he signed a release
for a certified cheque of 1,000 dollars.

165
00:20:12,700 --> 00:20:16,500
- How did he do that?
- Made him an offer he couldn't refuse.

166
00:20:18,300 --> 00:20:23,300
- What was that?
- Luca Brasi held a gun to his head,

167
00:20:23,300 --> 00:20:28,500
and father said that either his brains or
his signature would be on the contract.

168
00:20:33,500 --> 00:20:35,200
That's a true story.

169
00:20:46,500 --> 00:20:49,300
That's my family, Kay. It's not me.

170
00:21:01,800 --> 00:21:03,500
Beautiful!

171
00:21:35,900 --> 00:21:38,000
I'll take care of it.

172
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:40,000
Tom...

173
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:43,600
I want you to find Santino.
Tell him to come to the office.

174
00:21:50,900 --> 00:21:53,900
How are you, Fredo?

175
00:21:53,900 --> 00:21:56,500
My brother Fredo,
this is Kay Adams.

176
00:21:57,600 --> 00:22:00,000
- Hi.
- How are you doing?

177
00:22:01,900 --> 00:22:06,400
- This is my brother Mike.
- Are you having a good time?

178
00:22:06,400 --> 00:22:09,000
Yeah. This is your friend?

179
00:22:09,000 --> 00:22:14,400
I don't know what to do.
My voice is weak. It's weak.

180
00:22:15,500 --> 00:22:22,000
Anyway, if I had this part in the picture,
it puts me right back on top again.

181
00:22:22,000 --> 00:22:27,500
But this... man won't give it to me,
the head of the studio.

182
00:22:27,500 --> 00:22:30,700
- What's his name?
- Woltz.

183
00:22:30,700 --> 00:22:35,200
He won't give it to me,
and he says there's no chance.

184
00:22:39,100 --> 00:22:40,400
Sonny?

185
00:22:42,000 --> 00:22:43,100
Sonny?

186
00:22:49,700 --> 00:22:50,800
Sonny?

187
00:22:51,800 --> 00:22:54,600
- Sonny, are you in there?
- What?

188
00:22:54,600 --> 00:22:56,100
The old man wants you.

189
00:22:57,800 --> 00:22:59,500
One minute.

190
00:23:14,000 --> 00:23:19,000
A month ago he bought the movie rights
to this book, a best-seller.

191
00:23:19,000 --> 00:23:22,600
The main character
is a guy just like me.

192
00:23:22,600 --> 00:23:25,200
I wouldn't even have to act.

193
00:23:26,300 --> 00:23:29,200
Godfather, I don't know what to do.

194
00:23:30,500 --> 00:23:34,900
You can act like a man!
What's the matter with you?

195
00:23:34,900 --> 00:23:40,700
Is this how you turned out a Hollywood
finocchio, that cries like a woman?

196
00:23:40,700 --> 00:23:44,600
"What can I do? What can I do?"
What is that nonsense?

197
00:23:44,600 --> 00:23:46,500
Ridiculous.

198
00:23:51,100 --> 00:23:54,400
- You spend time with your family?
- Sure I do.

199
00:23:54,400 --> 00:23:56,000
Good.

200
00:23:56,000 --> 00:24:01,300
Because a man who doesn't spend time
with his family can never be a real man.

201
00:24:06,400 --> 00:24:10,000
You look terrible. I want you to eat.

202
00:24:10,000 --> 00:24:15,400
Rest, and in a month this Hollywood
big shot will give you what you want.

203
00:24:15,400 --> 00:24:18,700
It's too late, they start shooting
in a week.

204
00:24:18,700 --> 00:24:21,800
I'm going to make him an offer
he can't refuse.

205
00:24:24,600 --> 00:24:29,600
Just go outside and enjoy yourself,
and forget about all this nonsense.

206
00:24:32,100 --> 00:24:35,100
- I want you to leave it all to me.
- All right.

207
00:24:59,900 --> 00:25:05,300
- What time does my daughter leave?
- Soon, after they cut the cake.

208
00:25:05,300 --> 00:25:08,800
Do we give your son-in-law
something important?

209
00:25:08,800 --> 00:25:14,300
Never. Give him a living, but never
discuss the family business with him.

210
00:25:14,300 --> 00:25:17,200
- What else?
- Virgil Sollozzo called.

211
00:25:17,200 --> 00:25:21,700
- We'll have to see him next week.
- When you come back from California.

212
00:25:23,100 --> 00:25:26,600
- When am I going to California?
- Tonight.

213
00:25:26,600 --> 00:25:32,000
I want you to talk to this movie big shot
and settle this business for Johnny.

214
00:25:33,000 --> 00:25:37,400
If there's nothing else, I'd like to go
to my daughter's wedding.

215
00:25:39,300 --> 00:25:42,200
Carlo, we're going to take the picture.

216
00:25:43,400 --> 00:25:45,300
Wait a minute.

217
00:25:45,300 --> 00:25:47,700
No, Michael. Not me.

218
00:25:52,000 --> 00:25:55,200
Okay, that's it. Just like that. Hold it!

219
00:27:45,000 --> 00:27:48,600
- You need a little more heat on that arc.
- Start talking.

220
00:27:48,600 --> 00:27:51,900
I was sent by a friend
of Johnny Fontane.

221
00:27:51,900 --> 00:27:55,700
This friend would give
his friendship to Mr. Woltz,

222
00:27:55,700 --> 00:27:58,500
if Mr. Woltz would grant us a favour.

223
00:27:58,500 --> 00:28:00,900
Woltz is listening.

224
00:28:00,900 --> 00:28:05,400
Give Johnny the part in that war film
you're starting next week.

225
00:28:10,700 --> 00:28:15,900
And what favour would your friend
grant Mr. Woltz?

226
00:28:15,900 --> 00:28:19,400
He could make your future union
problems disappear.

227
00:28:19,400 --> 00:28:23,400
And one of your stars has just moved
from marijuana to heroin.

228
00:28:23,600 --> 00:28:28,000
Are you trying to muscle me?
Listen, you son-of-a-bitch!

229
00:28:28,000 --> 00:28:32,500
Let me lay it on the line. Johnny
Fontane will never get that movie!

230
00:28:32,500 --> 00:28:37,300
No matter how many Dago Guinea
greaseballs come out of the woodwork!

231
00:28:37,300 --> 00:28:41,300
- I'm German-Irish.
- Listen here, my Kraut-Mick friend.

232
00:28:41,300 --> 00:28:45,700
- I'm going to make trouble for you!
- I'm a lawyer. I haven't threatened...

233
00:28:45,700 --> 00:28:49,200
I know New York's big lawyers.
Who are you?

234
00:28:49,200 --> 00:28:54,600
I have a special practice. I handle
one client. I'll wait for your call.

235
00:28:56,600 --> 00:28:59,600
By the way, I admire your pictures
very much.

236
00:29:04,300 --> 00:29:06,700
Check him out.

237
00:29:28,300 --> 00:29:31,000
- It's really beautiful.
- Look at this.

238
00:29:31,000 --> 00:29:35,600
- It used to decorate a king's palace.
- Very nice.

239
00:29:35,600 --> 00:29:38,100
Why didn't you say
you work for Corleone?

240
00:29:38,100 --> 00:29:42,600
I thought you were some cheap hustler
Johnny was running in.

241
00:29:42,600 --> 00:29:45,900
- I only use his name when necessary.
- How's your drink?

242
00:29:45,900 --> 00:29:49,400
- Fine.
- Now I'll show you something beautiful.

243
00:29:49,400 --> 00:29:52,300
You do appreciate beauty, don't you?

244
00:29:55,000 --> 00:29:58,100
There you are.
600,000 dollars on four hoofs.

245
00:29:58,100 --> 00:30:01,900
I bet Russian czars never paid
that for a single horse.

246
00:30:01,900 --> 00:30:03,400
Khartoum.

247
00:30:04,400 --> 00:30:05,700
Khartoum.

248
00:30:07,100 --> 00:30:11,400
I'm not going to race him, though.
I'm going to put him out to stud.

249
00:30:13,100 --> 00:30:14,400
Thanks, Tony.

250
00:30:15,300 --> 00:30:18,400
Let's get something to eat.

251
00:30:18,400 --> 00:30:21,900
Corleone is Johnny's godfather.

252
00:30:21,900 --> 00:30:26,500
To the Italian people that's
a very sacred, close relationship.

253
00:30:26,500 --> 00:30:31,800
I respect it. Tell him to ask me anything
else. This favour I can't give him.

254
00:30:32,700 --> 00:30:36,200
He never asks a second favour
when he's been refused the first.

255
00:30:36,200 --> 00:30:42,400
You don't understand. Johnny Fontane
never gets that movie.

256
00:30:42,400 --> 00:30:46,300
That part is perfect for him.
It'll make him a big star.

257
00:30:46,300 --> 00:30:50,100
I'm going to run him out of the business,
and let me tell you why.

258
00:30:52,300 --> 00:30:57,200
Johnny Fontane ruined one of Woltz
International's most valuable protégés.

259
00:30:57,200 --> 00:31:02,600
We trained her for five years.
Singing, acting, dancing lessons.

260
00:31:02,600 --> 00:31:07,300
I spent hundreds of thousands of dollars
on her, to make her a big star.

261
00:31:07,300 --> 00:31:10,100
Let me be even more frank.

262
00:31:10,100 --> 00:31:15,200
To show you that I'm not a hard-hearted
man. That it's not all dollars and cents.

263
00:31:15,200 --> 00:31:18,900
She was beautiful.
She was young and innocent!

264
00:31:18,900 --> 00:31:24,300
She's the greatest piece of ass I've had
and I've had them all over the world.

265
00:31:24,300 --> 00:31:30,700
Then Johnny Fontane comes along with
his olive oil voice and Guinea charm.

266
00:31:30,700 --> 00:31:32,400
And she runs off.

267
00:31:33,700 --> 00:31:36,700
She threw it all away
just to make me look ridiculous!

268
00:31:37,900 --> 00:31:43,200
And a man in my position can't afford
to be made to look ridiculous!

269
00:31:43,200 --> 00:31:45,600
You get the hell out of here!

270
00:31:45,600 --> 00:31:50,000
If that goombah tries any rough stuff,
tell him I'm no bandleader.

271
00:31:51,200 --> 00:31:54,200
Yeah, I heard that story.

272
00:31:55,100 --> 00:31:59,100
Thank you for dinner
and a very pleasant evening.

273
00:31:59,100 --> 00:32:02,000
Maybe your car can take me
to the airport.

274
00:32:02,000 --> 00:32:05,700
Mr. Corleone insists on hearing
bad news immediately.

275
00:33:58,400 --> 00:34:02,400
- You're not too tired, are you, Tom?
- No, I slept on the plane.

276
00:34:02,400 --> 00:34:05,500
I have the Sollozzo notes here.

277
00:34:05,500 --> 00:34:06,800
Now...

278
00:34:08,900 --> 00:34:13,900
Sollozzo is known as The Turk. He's
supposed to be very good with a knife,

279
00:34:14,500 --> 00:34:19,000
but only in matters of business
with reasonable complaint.

280
00:34:19,000 --> 00:34:22,100
His business is narcotics.

281
00:34:22,100 --> 00:34:25,700
He has fields in Turkey,
where they grow poppy.

282
00:34:25,700 --> 00:34:29,700
In Sicily he has plants to process them
into heroin.

283
00:34:29,800 --> 00:34:33,400
He needs cash, he needs protection
from the police.

284
00:34:33,400 --> 00:34:37,400
He'll give a piece of the action.
I don't know how much.

285
00:34:37,400 --> 00:34:42,600
The Tattaglia family is behind him here.
They have to be in it for something.

286
00:34:43,600 --> 00:34:48,500
- What about his prison record?
- One term in Italy, one here.

287
00:34:48,500 --> 00:34:51,100
He's known as a top narcotics man.

288
00:34:51,100 --> 00:34:56,600
- Santino, what do you think?
- A lot of money in that white powder.

289
00:34:58,400 --> 00:34:59,900
Tom?

290
00:34:59,900 --> 00:35:03,900
Yes. There's more money in narcotics
than anything else.

291
00:35:04,200 --> 00:35:09,000
If we don't get into it, somebody else
will, maybe the five families.

292
00:35:09,000 --> 00:35:13,500
With that money they can buy
more police and political power.

293
00:35:13,500 --> 00:35:15,700
Then they come after us.

294
00:35:15,700 --> 00:35:22,100
Now we have unions and gambling, and
that's great, but narcotics is the future.

295
00:35:22,100 --> 00:35:27,800
If we don't get a piece of that action,
we risk everything in ten years' time.

296
00:35:31,900 --> 00:35:34,900
So? What's your answer
going to be, Pop?

297
00:35:39,800 --> 00:35:42,200
Don Corleone.

298
00:35:43,700 --> 00:35:47,100
I need a man who has powerful friends.

299
00:35:47,100 --> 00:35:49,800
I need a million dollars in cash.

300
00:35:49,800 --> 00:35:55,700
I need those politicians that you carry
in your pocket, like nickels and dimes.

301
00:35:57,100 --> 00:36:01,100
- What is the interest for my family?
- 30 percent.

302
00:36:01,300 --> 00:36:05,300
In the first year your end should be
three, four million dollars.

303
00:36:05,300 --> 00:36:07,500
And then it would go up.

304
00:36:08,500 --> 00:36:11,900
And what is the interest
for the Tattaglia family?

305
00:36:13,900 --> 00:36:16,000
My compliments.

306
00:36:19,400 --> 00:36:22,000
I'll take care of them, out of my share.

307
00:36:22,800 --> 00:36:27,200
So I receive 30 percent for finance,

308
00:36:27,200 --> 00:36:30,800
political influence and legal protection?

309
00:36:30,800 --> 00:36:32,500
That's right.

310
00:36:33,600 --> 00:36:37,600
Why do you come to me?
Why do I deserve this generosity?

311
00:36:37,600 --> 00:36:43,000
If you consider a million dollars in cash
just finance,

312
00:36:43,000 --> 00:36:45,300
ti saluto, Don Corleone.

313
00:36:55,700 --> 00:37:01,000
I said that I would see you, because
I heard you were a serious man,

314
00:37:01,000 --> 00:37:03,300
to be treated with respect.

315
00:37:08,000 --> 00:37:11,300
But, I must say no to you.

316
00:37:12,400 --> 00:37:14,900
And I'll give you my reason.

317
00:37:15,400 --> 00:37:18,200
It's true, I have a lot of friends in politics.

318
00:37:19,500 --> 00:37:23,900
They wouldn't be friendly long if I was
involved in drugs instead of gambling,

319
00:37:23,900 --> 00:37:29,700
which they regard as a harmless vice,
but drugs is a dirty business.

320
00:37:29,700 --> 00:37:34,700
It doesn't make any difference to me
what a man does for a living.

321
00:37:34,700 --> 00:37:40,100
But your business is...
a little dangerous.

322
00:37:40,100 --> 00:37:44,100
If you're worried about security,
the Tattaglias will guarantee it.

323
00:37:44,600 --> 00:37:48,100
- The Tattaglias would guarantee our...
- Wait a minute.

324
00:37:55,400 --> 00:38:00,100
I have a sentimental weakness
for my children, and I spoil them.

325
00:38:00,100 --> 00:38:03,900
They talk when they should listen.
But anyway...

326
00:38:03,900 --> 00:38:09,300
Signor Sollozzo, my no is final. I wish to
congratulate you on your new business.

327
00:38:09,300 --> 00:38:12,700
I know you'll do well, and good luck.

328
00:38:12,700 --> 00:38:17,800
Especially since your interests
don't conflict with mine. Thank you.

329
00:38:38,200 --> 00:38:40,100
Santino.

330
00:38:40,100 --> 00:38:42,000
Come here.

331
00:38:44,300 --> 00:38:50,900
What's the matter with you? Your brain
is going soft from playing with that girl.

332
00:38:50,900 --> 00:38:55,300
Never tell anybody outside the family
what you're thinking again.

333
00:38:56,500 --> 00:38:57,800
Go on.

334
00:39:01,700 --> 00:39:04,500
Tom, what's this nonsense?

335
00:39:04,500 --> 00:39:08,200
It's from Johnny.
He's starring in that new film.

336
00:39:10,400 --> 00:39:13,100
- Take it away.
- Take it over there.

337
00:39:14,300 --> 00:39:15,800
And...

338
00:39:16,800 --> 00:39:19,200
...tell Luca Brasi to come in.

339
00:39:25,100 --> 00:39:28,600
I'm a little worried
about this Sollozzo fellow.

340
00:39:28,600 --> 00:39:31,300
Find out what he's got
under his fingernails.

341
00:39:32,600 --> 00:39:36,300
Go to the Tattaglias.

342
00:39:36,300 --> 00:39:41,900
Make them think that you're not
too happy with our family

343
00:39:41,900 --> 00:39:44,400
and find out what you can.

344
00:40:01,800 --> 00:40:05,200
I got something for your mother
and for Sonny

345
00:40:05,200 --> 00:40:10,200
and a tie for Freddy,
and Tom Hagen got the Reynolds pen.

346
00:40:10,200 --> 00:40:13,500
- What do you want for Christmas?
- Just you.

347
00:40:45,100 --> 00:40:47,100
Andiamo, Fredo.

348
00:40:47,100 --> 00:40:50,700
- Tell Paulie to get the car.
- Okay, Pop.

349
00:40:50,700 --> 00:40:54,500
I'll have to get it myself.
Paulie called in sick this morning.

350
00:40:56,400 --> 00:40:59,500
Paulie's a good kid.
I don't mind getting the car.

351
00:41:03,000 --> 00:41:05,000
Buon Natale, caro. Grazie.

352
00:41:47,800 --> 00:41:52,400
- Luca! I'm Bruno Tattaglia.
- I know.

353
00:42:02,200 --> 00:42:03,700
You know who I am?

354
00:42:03,700 --> 00:42:05,300
I know you.

355
00:42:05,300 --> 00:42:08,800
You have been talking to the
Tattaglia family...right?

356
00:42:10,200 --> 00:42:14,900
I think you and I can do business.

357
00:42:16,500 --> 00:42:19,100
I need someone strong like you.

358
00:42:19,100 --> 00:42:22,900
I heard you are not happy...

359
00:42:22,900 --> 00:42:25,300
...with the Corleone family.

360
00:42:25,300 --> 00:42:29,100
Want to join me?

361
00:42:29,100 --> 00:42:31,600
What's in it for me?

362
00:42:31,600 --> 00:42:35,400
$50,000 to start with.

363
00:42:38,900 --> 00:42:41,200
Not bad!

364
00:42:41,200 --> 00:42:44,200
Agreed?

365
00:43:42,200 --> 00:43:46,000
Tom! Tom Hagen. Merry Christmas.

366
00:43:46,000 --> 00:43:51,200
- Glad to see you. I want to talk to you.
- I haven't got time.

367
00:43:51,200 --> 00:43:54,200
Make time, Consigliere. Get in the car.

368
00:43:56,000 --> 00:44:00,800
What are you worried about? lf I wanted
to kill you, you'd be dead already.

369
00:44:00,800 --> 00:44:02,100
Get in.

370
00:44:13,100 --> 00:44:16,800
- Fredo, I'm going to buy some fruit.
- Okay, Pop.

371
00:44:23,100 --> 00:44:26,500
Merry Christmas. I want some fruit.

372
00:45:54,000 --> 00:45:58,000
Would you like me better
if I were a nun? Like in the story.

373
00:46:01,000 --> 00:46:02,300
No.

374
00:46:02,300 --> 00:46:07,100
- What if I were Ingrid Bergman?
- Now, that's a thought.

375
00:46:09,200 --> 00:46:10,800
Michael.

376
00:46:10,800 --> 00:46:16,000
No, I wouldn't like you better if you were
Ingrid Bergman. What's the matter?

377
00:46:32,400 --> 00:46:35,200
They don't say if he's dead or alive.

378
00:46:57,100 --> 00:47:00,600
- Sonny, it's Michael.
- Where have you been?

379
00:47:00,600 --> 00:47:03,400
- Is he all right?
- We don't know yet.

380
00:47:03,400 --> 00:47:08,200
There are all kinds of stories.
He was hit bad, Mikey.

381
00:47:09,500 --> 00:47:12,600
- Are you there?
- Yeah, I'm here.

382
00:47:12,600 --> 00:47:17,200
- Where have you been? I was worried.
- Didn't Tom tell you I called?

383
00:47:17,200 --> 00:47:21,900
No. Look, come home, kid.
You should be with Mama, you hear?

384
00:47:29,300 --> 00:47:31,100
Oh, my God.

385
00:47:35,000 --> 00:47:36,500
Sonny!

386
00:47:45,500 --> 00:47:47,600
Stay back there.

387
00:47:47,600 --> 00:47:50,300
- Who is it?
- Open up, it's Clemenza.

388
00:47:52,700 --> 00:47:55,900
There's more news about your old man.

389
00:47:55,900 --> 00:47:58,700
Word is out that he's already dead.

390
00:47:58,700 --> 00:48:02,700
- What's the matter with you?
- Take it easy!

391
00:48:02,700 --> 00:48:06,000
- Where was Paulie?
- Sick. He's been sick all winter.

392
00:48:06,000 --> 00:48:09,100
- How often?
- Only three, four times.

393
00:48:09,100 --> 00:48:12,500
- Freddy didn't want a new bodyguard.
- Pick him up now.

394
00:48:12,500 --> 00:48:17,300
I don't care how sick he is. Bring him
to my father's house right now.

395
00:48:17,300 --> 00:48:20,600
- You want anyone sent over here?
- No. Go ahead.

396
00:48:29,700 --> 00:48:33,100
I'm going to have a couple of our people
come over to the house.

397
00:48:36,500 --> 00:48:38,800
- Hello?
- Santino Corleone?

398
00:48:38,800 --> 00:48:41,800
- Yeah.
- We have Tom Hagen.

399
00:48:41,800 --> 00:48:45,500
In three hours he'll be released
with our proposition.

400
00:48:45,500 --> 00:48:48,900
Listen to what he has to say
before you do anything.

401
00:48:48,900 --> 00:48:53,600
What's done is done. Don't lose that
famous temper of yours, Sonny.

402
00:48:53,600 --> 00:48:55,300
I'll wait.

403
00:49:09,600 --> 00:49:11,600
Your boss is dead.

404
00:49:14,500 --> 00:49:18,900
I know you're not in the muscle end
of the family, so don't be scared.

405
00:49:20,000 --> 00:49:24,400
I want you to help the Corleones
and me.

406
00:49:27,900 --> 00:49:32,400
We got him outside his office
about an hour after we picked you up.

407
00:49:33,900 --> 00:49:35,200
Drink it.

408
00:49:39,600 --> 00:49:43,000
It's up to you to make peace
between me and Sonny.

409
00:49:47,500 --> 00:49:50,200
Sonny was hot for my deal, wasn't he?

410
00:49:51,700 --> 00:49:54,500
And you knew
it was the right thing to do.

411
00:49:55,700 --> 00:50:01,100
- Sonny will come after you.
- That will be his first reaction, sure.

412
00:50:02,200 --> 00:50:08,000
So you have to talk sense into him.
The Tattaglia family is behind me.

413
00:50:08,800 --> 00:50:14,000
The other New York families will go
along with anything to prevent war.

414
00:50:14,000 --> 00:50:19,800
Let's face it, with all due respect,
the Don - rest in peace - was slipping.

415
00:50:22,200 --> 00:50:25,200
Ten years ago,
could I have gotten to him?

416
00:50:29,100 --> 00:50:33,500
Well, now he's dead, Tom,
and nothing can bring him back.

417
00:50:34,800 --> 00:50:41,200
You've got to talk to Sonny, to the
Caporegimes, Tessio, fat Clemenza.

418
00:50:45,600 --> 00:50:48,100
It's good business, Tom.

419
00:50:49,100 --> 00:50:54,400
I'll try. But even Sonny won't be able
to call off Luca Brasi.

420
00:50:57,000 --> 00:50:58,800
Yeah, well...

421
00:51:00,600 --> 00:51:02,900
Let me worry about Luca.

422
00:51:08,300 --> 00:51:10,100
You just talk to Sonny.

423
00:51:10,700 --> 00:51:13,000
And the other two kids.

424
00:51:15,800 --> 00:51:18,700
- I'll do my best.
- Good.

425
00:51:20,700 --> 00:51:23,800
Now you can go.

426
00:51:30,100 --> 00:51:35,000
I don't like violence, Tom.
I'm a businessman.

427
00:51:35,000 --> 00:51:37,500
Blood is a big expense.

428
00:51:58,500 --> 00:52:00,400
He's still alive.

429
00:52:00,400 --> 00:52:04,400
They hit him with five shots,
and he's still alive!

430
00:52:04,600 --> 00:52:09,600
That's bad luck for me, and bad luck
for you if you don't make that deal.

431
00:52:54,000 --> 00:52:58,300
Your mother is at the hospital with
your father. Looks like he'll pull through.

432
00:53:00,500 --> 00:53:07,100
It's a lot of bad blood. Sollozzo, Philip
Tattaglia, Bruno Tattaglia, Ramon...

433
00:53:07,100 --> 00:53:10,800
- You gonna kill all those guys?
- Stay out of it.

434
00:53:10,800 --> 00:53:13,400
If you get rid of Sollozzo,
everything falls into line.

435
00:53:13,400 --> 00:53:17,900
What about Luca?
Sollozzo thinks he can control him.

436
00:53:17,900 --> 00:53:21,500
If Luca sold out, we're in a lot of trouble.

437
00:53:21,500 --> 00:53:25,500
- Has anyone been in touch with Luca?
- We've been trying all night.

438
00:53:25,500 --> 00:53:29,800
- Hey, do me a favour...
- Luca never sleeps over with a broad.

439
00:53:31,500 --> 00:53:36,700
Well, Tom, you're consigliere.
What do we do if the old man dies?

440
00:53:37,800 --> 00:53:44,100
If we lose the old man, we lose the
political contacts and half our strength.

441
00:53:44,100 --> 00:53:49,600
The other New York families might
support Sollozzo to avoid a long war.

442
00:53:49,600 --> 00:53:54,400
This is almost 1946.
Nobody wants bloodshed anymore.

443
00:53:54,400 --> 00:53:56,000
If your father dies...

444
00:53:58,600 --> 00:54:00,100
...you make the deal.

445
00:54:00,100 --> 00:54:04,900
- Easy to say. He's not your father.
- I'm as much a son as you or Mike.

446
00:54:09,800 --> 00:54:11,400
What is it?

447
00:54:12,400 --> 00:54:18,200
- Paulie, I told you to stay put.
- The guy at the gates has a package.

448
00:54:18,200 --> 00:54:20,800
Tessio, go see what it is.

449
00:54:23,600 --> 00:54:26,000
- Shall I stay?
- Yeah. Are you all right?

450
00:54:26,000 --> 00:54:29,900
- I'm fine.
- There's food. Are you hungry?

451
00:54:29,900 --> 00:54:33,500
- No.
- A drink? Brandy will sweat it out.

452
00:54:33,500 --> 00:54:36,100
- Go ahead.
- That might be a good idea.

453
00:54:37,600 --> 00:54:42,800
Take care of that son-of-a-bitch.
Paulie sold out the old man.

454
00:54:42,800 --> 00:54:47,200
- Make that the first thing on your list.
- Understood.

455
00:54:47,800 --> 00:54:51,800
Mickey, tomorrow, get some guys
and go to Luca's apartment.

456
00:54:51,900 --> 00:54:55,900
Maybe we shouldn't get Mike
mixed up in this too directly.

457
00:54:58,300 --> 00:55:01,800
Hanging around the house on
the phone would be a big help.

458
00:55:02,900 --> 00:55:04,800
Try Luca again.

459
00:55:13,800 --> 00:55:16,700
- What's this?
- A Sicilian message.

460
00:55:16,700 --> 00:55:19,200
It means Luca Brasi
sleeps with the fishes.

461
00:55:33,200 --> 00:55:35,500
- I'm going.
- When will you be home?

462
00:55:35,500 --> 00:55:37,100
Probably late.

463
00:55:39,700 --> 00:55:43,600
- Don't forget the cannoli!
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.

464
00:55:45,600 --> 00:55:50,100
Rocco, sit on the other side.
You block the rear-view mirror.

465
00:55:51,500 --> 00:55:55,100
Sonny's running wild. He wants
to go to mattresses already.

466
00:55:55,100 --> 00:56:01,100
We have to find a spot on the
West Side. Try 309 West 43rd Street.

467
00:56:01,100 --> 00:56:04,700
- Know a good spot on the West Side?
- I'll think about it.

468
00:56:04,700 --> 00:56:08,500
Think while you're driving.
I want to hit New York this month.

469
00:56:08,500 --> 00:56:10,200
Watch the kids.

470
00:56:21,100 --> 00:56:27,000
Paulie, go down 39th Street, pick up
18 mattresses and bring me the bill.

471
00:56:27,000 --> 00:56:28,500
Yeah, all right.

472
00:56:28,500 --> 00:56:33,100
Make sure they're clean, because
the guys will be there a long time.

473
00:56:33,100 --> 00:56:37,100
- They're clean and exterminated.
- That's a bad word to use.

474
00:56:37,300 --> 00:56:41,300
Exterminate! Watch out,
so we don't exterminate you!

475
00:56:48,200 --> 00:56:50,700
Pull over. I've got to take a leak.
