1
00:00:20,748 --> 00:00:23,979
Leave the gun. Take the cannoli.

2
00:00:43,604 --> 00:00:45,401
Hey, Mike! Hey, Mikey!

3
00:00:46,907 --> 00:00:48,841
- Yeah.
- Phone call!

4
00:00:55,082 --> 00:00:57,448
- Who is it?
- Some girl.

5
00:01:01,722 --> 00:01:04,054
- Hello. Kay?
- How's your father?

6
00:01:04,191 --> 00:01:05,988
He's going to make it.

7
00:01:06,727 --> 00:01:08,558
I love you.

8
00:01:09,830 --> 00:01:11,422
I love you!

9
00:01:12,432 --> 00:01:14,866
- Michael?
- Yeah, I know.

10
00:01:15,002 --> 00:01:17,903
- Tell me you love me.
- I can't talk.

11
00:01:18,038 --> 00:01:19,903
Can't you say it?

12
00:01:20,974 --> 00:01:22,874
I'll see you tonight.

13
00:01:23,744 --> 00:01:26,770
Why don't you tell that nice girl
you love her?

14
00:01:26,914 --> 00:01:31,715
I love you with all my heart. If I don't
see you again soon, I'm going to die!

15
00:01:32,786 --> 00:01:37,621
Come and learn something. You might
have to cook for 20 guys some day.

16
00:01:37,758 --> 00:01:41,421
You start with a little oil,
then fry some garlic.

17
00:01:41,562 --> 00:01:46,932
Throw in some tomatoes, tomato paste,
fry it and make sure it doesn't stick.

18
00:01:47,067 --> 00:01:51,231
You get it to a boil, you shove in
all your sausage and meatballs.

19
00:01:53,140 --> 00:01:55,199
Add a little bit of wine.

20
00:01:58,478 --> 00:02:02,881
And a little bit of sugar. That's my trick.

21
00:02:03,016 --> 00:02:07,282
Cut the crap. I have more important
things for you. How's Paulie?

22
00:02:07,421 --> 00:02:09,651
You won't see him no more.

23
00:02:11,091 --> 00:02:13,525
- Where are you going?
- To the city.

24
00:02:13,660 --> 00:02:17,118
- Send bodyguards with him.
- I'm going to the hospital...

25
00:02:17,264 --> 00:02:20,597
He'll be all right. Sollozzo knows
he's a civilian.

26
00:02:20,734 --> 00:02:22,861
- Be careful.
- Yes, sir.

27
00:02:25,806 --> 00:02:28,070
Send somebody with him anyway.

28
00:02:56,536 --> 00:02:59,903
- I have to go.
- Can I go with you?

29
00:03:01,108 --> 00:03:05,704
No, Kay. There will be detectives there,
people from the press.

30
00:03:05,846 --> 00:03:08,144
I'll wait in the cab.

31
00:03:10,284 --> 00:03:12,912
I don't want you to get involved.

32
00:03:15,656 --> 00:03:18,124
When will I see you again?

33
00:03:24,164 --> 00:03:28,294
Go back to New Hampshire, and I'll
call you at your parents' house.

34
00:03:30,003 --> 00:03:34,963
- When will I see you again, Michael?
- I don't know.

35
00:05:46,973 --> 00:05:50,773
What are you doing here?
You're not supposed to be here.

36
00:05:50,911 --> 00:05:54,403
I'm Michael Corleone. This is my father.

37
00:05:54,548 --> 00:05:57,108
What happened to the guards?

38
00:05:57,250 --> 00:06:02,278
Your father had too many visitors.
They interfered with hospital service.

39
00:06:02,422 --> 00:06:05,789
The police made them leave
about ten minutes ago.

40
00:06:10,230 --> 00:06:14,166
Get me Long Beach 45620, please.

41
00:06:16,837 --> 00:06:19,670
Nurse. Wait a minute. Stay here.

42
00:06:23,143 --> 00:06:27,978
Sonny, I'm at the hospital.
I got here late, there's nobody here.

43
00:06:28,115 --> 00:06:32,142
No Tessio's men, no detectives,
nobody. Papa's all alone.

44
00:06:32,285 --> 00:06:34,981
- Don't panic.
- I won't panic.

45
00:06:36,356 --> 00:06:39,325
I'm sorry, but you will have to leave.

46
00:06:42,095 --> 00:06:47,863
We're going to move him to another
room. Can you disconnect the tubes?

47
00:06:48,001 --> 00:06:51,493
- That's out of the question!
- Do you know my father?

48
00:06:51,638 --> 00:06:55,870
Men are coming here to kill him.
Do you understand?

49
00:06:56,009 --> 00:06:58,000
Help me, please.

50
00:08:14,854 --> 00:08:18,654
- Who are you?
- I am Enzo, the baker.

51
00:08:19,693 --> 00:08:21,820
- Remember me?
- Enzo.

52
00:08:21,962 --> 00:08:24,897
You'd better go,
there's going to be trouble.

53
00:08:25,031 --> 00:08:29,661
If there is trouble, I'll stay here to
help you. For your father.

54
00:08:31,705 --> 00:08:35,766
Listen. Wait for me outside,
in front of the hospital, all right?

55
00:08:35,909 --> 00:08:37,968
I'll be out in a minute.

56
00:08:51,825 --> 00:08:55,852
Just lie here, Pop.
I'll take care of you now.

57
00:08:57,497 --> 00:08:59,522
I'm with you now.

58
00:09:01,134 --> 00:09:02,658
I'm with you.

59
00:09:38,204 --> 00:09:40,331
Get rid of these. Come here.

60
00:09:41,308 --> 00:09:45,472
Put your hand in your pocket, like you
have a gun. You'll be all right.

61
00:10:37,130 --> 00:10:39,098
You did good.

62
00:11:27,280 --> 00:11:30,477
I thought all you Guinea hoods
were locked up!

63
00:11:30,617 --> 00:11:35,054
- Why isn't anyone guarding my father?
- You little punk!

64
00:11:35,188 --> 00:11:39,090
Don't you tell me my business!
I pulled them off.

65
00:11:39,225 --> 00:11:45,255
- Stay away from this hospital!
- Not until my father's room is guarded.

66
00:11:45,965 --> 00:11:49,298
- Phil, take him in!
- The kid's clean, Captain.

67
00:11:49,436 --> 00:11:53,668
- He's a war hero. He's never been...
- I said take him in!

68
00:11:55,475 --> 00:12:01,277
- What's The Turk paying you?
- Take a hold of him. Stand him up.

69
00:12:01,781 --> 00:12:03,373
Stand him up straight.

70
00:12:25,638 --> 00:12:31,338
I'm the Corleone's attorney. These men
are hired to protect Vito Corleone.

71
00:12:31,478 --> 00:12:33,742
They're licensed to carry firearms.

72
00:12:33,880 --> 00:12:38,374
If you interfere, you'll have to appear
before the judge and show cause.

73
00:12:38,518 --> 00:12:40,713
Let him go.

74
00:13:13,052 --> 00:13:16,749
- What's with all the new faces?
- We'll need them now.

75
00:13:16,890 --> 00:13:19,415
After the hospital thing, Sonny got mad.

76
00:13:19,559 --> 00:13:22,687
We hit Bruno Tattaglia this morning.

77
00:13:24,030 --> 00:13:25,998
Jesus Christ.

78
00:13:32,872 --> 00:13:35,568
Looks like a fortress around here.

79
00:13:37,310 --> 00:13:42,771
Tommasuccio! Hey... 1 00 buttonmen
on the street 24 hours a day.

80
00:13:42,916 --> 00:13:46,545
That Turk shows one hair on his ass,
he's dead.

81
00:13:48,588 --> 00:13:50,579
Mike, let me look at you.

82
00:13:54,661 --> 00:13:57,653
You're beautiful, beautiful.
You're gorgeous.

83
00:13:57,797 --> 00:14:03,463
The Turk wants to talk! Lmagine
the nerve of the son-of-a-bitch.

84
00:14:03,603 --> 00:14:06,265
- He wants a meeting today.
- What did he say?

85
00:14:06,406 --> 00:14:11,070
What did he say... He wants us to send
Michael to hear the proposition.

86
00:14:11,210 --> 00:14:14,668
He promises that the deal
is too good to refuse.

87
00:14:14,814 --> 00:14:17,874
- And Bruno Tattaglia?
- That's part of the deal.

88
00:14:18,017 --> 00:14:22,181
- He cancels out what they did to Father.
- We should listen to them.

89
00:14:22,322 --> 00:14:25,382
No more! Not this time, Consigliere.

90
00:14:25,525 --> 00:14:29,052
No more meetings, discussions,
or Sollozzo tricks.

91
00:14:29,195 --> 00:14:31,993
I want Sollozzo, or we go to war...

92
00:14:32,131 --> 00:14:35,225
- The other families...
- They hand me Sollozzo!

93
00:14:35,368 --> 00:14:37,962
This is business, not personal!

94
00:14:38,104 --> 00:14:42,973
- They shot my father...
- Even that was business, not personal.

95
00:14:43,109 --> 00:14:46,806
Then business will have to suffer.
Do me a favour.

96
00:14:46,946 --> 00:14:50,973
No more advice on how to
patch things up. Just help me win.

97
00:14:57,357 --> 00:15:01,157
I found out about Captain McCluskey,
who broke Mike's jaw.

98
00:15:01,294 --> 00:15:05,492
He's definitely on Sollozzo's payroll,
and for big money.

99
00:15:05,632 --> 00:15:09,591
McCluskey has agreed to be
The Turk's bodyguard.

100
00:15:09,736 --> 00:15:13,570
So when Sollozzo is being guarded,
he's invulnerable.

101
00:15:13,706 --> 00:15:17,233
Nobody has ever gunned down
a New York police captain.

102
00:15:17,377 --> 00:15:23,179
All the families would come after you.
The Corleone family would be outcasts!

103
00:15:23,316 --> 00:15:27,013
Even the old man's political protection
would run for cover.

104
00:15:28,488 --> 00:15:32,652
Do me a favour.
Take this into consideration.

105
00:15:36,062 --> 00:15:38,292
All right, we'll wait.

106
00:15:43,403 --> 00:15:46,463
We can't wait. We can't wait.

107
00:15:47,774 --> 00:15:51,642
No matter what Sollozzo says,
he's going to kill Pop.

108
00:15:51,778 --> 00:15:55,544
That's the key for him.
We've got to get Sollozzo.

109
00:15:55,682 --> 00:15:59,982
- Mike is right.
- Let me ask you something.

110
00:16:00,119 --> 00:16:04,783
What about this McCluskey?
What do we do with this cop?

111
00:16:09,829 --> 00:16:12,593
They want to have a meeting
with me, right?

112
00:16:13,633 --> 00:16:18,297
It will be me, McCluskey and Sollozzo.

113
00:16:19,939 --> 00:16:22,169
Let's set the meeting.

114
00:16:24,143 --> 00:16:28,341
Get our informers to find out
where it's going to be held.

115
00:16:29,782 --> 00:16:33,343
We insist it's a public place.
A bar, a restaurant.

116
00:16:33,486 --> 00:16:37,650
Some place where there are people,
so I feel safe.

117
00:16:40,059 --> 00:16:42,926
They'll search me when I meet them,
right?

118
00:16:43,062 --> 00:16:45,360
So I can't have a weapon on me.

119
00:16:48,901 --> 00:16:54,533
But if Clemenza can figure out a way to
have a weapon planted there for me...

120
00:16:58,811 --> 00:17:01,507
...then I'll kill them both.

121
00:17:13,092 --> 00:17:17,791
Nice college boy. Didn't want to
get mixed up in the family business.

122
00:17:17,930 --> 00:17:21,525
Now you want to shoot a police captain
because he slapped you?

123
00:17:21,667 --> 00:17:28,163
This isn't like the army! You have to get
close and get their brains on your suit.

124
00:17:28,307 --> 00:17:31,333
You're taking this very personal.

125
00:17:31,477 --> 00:17:34,913
Tom, this is business
and he's taking it personal.

126
00:17:35,047 --> 00:17:38,676
- Where does it say you can't kill a cop?
- Mikey...

127
00:17:38,818 --> 00:17:45,519
I'm talking about a cop who's mixed up
in drugs, a dishonest cop.

128
00:17:45,658 --> 00:17:49,594
A cop who got mixed up in the rackets
and got what was coming.

129
00:17:50,163 --> 00:17:54,827
That's a terrific story. We have
newspaper people on the payroll, right?

130
00:17:56,002 --> 00:18:00,063
- They might like a story like that.
- They might.

131
00:18:03,609 --> 00:18:07,170
It's not personal, Sonny.
It's strictly business.

132
00:18:10,283 --> 00:18:15,482
It's as cold as they come. Impossible to
trace, so you don't worry about prints.

133
00:18:15,621 --> 00:18:19,990
I put a special tape on the trigger
and the butt. Try it.

134
00:18:31,938 --> 00:18:34,031
Is the trigger too tight?

135
00:18:37,443 --> 00:18:38,637
My ears!

136
00:18:38,778 --> 00:18:44,375
I left it noisy, so it scares away any
pain-in-the-ass innocent bystanders.

137
00:18:44,517 --> 00:18:47,145
You've shot them both.
Now what do you do?

138
00:18:49,388 --> 00:18:53,347
- Sit down, finish my dinner.
- Don't fool around.

139
00:18:53,492 --> 00:18:56,984
Let your hand drop to your side
and let the gun slip out.

140
00:18:57,129 --> 00:19:01,395
Everybody will still think you've got it.
They'll stare at your face,

141
00:19:01,534 --> 00:19:04,469
so walk out fast, but don't run.

142
00:19:04,604 --> 00:19:07,971
Don't look anybody in the eye,
but don't look away either.

143
00:19:08,107 --> 00:19:11,440
They'll be scared stiff,
so don't worry about nothing.

144
00:19:13,713 --> 00:19:17,877
You'll be all right. You'll take a vacation,
nobody knows where,

145
00:19:18,017 --> 00:19:19,712
and we'll catch the hell.

146
00:19:20,720 --> 00:19:24,451
- How bad do you think it will be?
- Pretty goddamn bad.

147
00:19:24,590 --> 00:19:27,650
All the other families will probably
line up against us.

148
00:19:27,793 --> 00:19:33,322
These things have to happen every five,
ten years. Gets rid of the bad blood.

149
00:19:33,466 --> 00:19:37,903
Been ten years since the last one.
You have to stop them at the beginning.

150
00:19:38,037 --> 00:19:44,101
Like they should have stopped Hitler in
Munich, not letting him get away with it.

151
00:19:45,111 --> 00:19:49,514
You know, Mike, we were all proud
of you. Being a hero and all.

152
00:19:49,649 --> 00:19:51,583
Your father too.

153
00:20:29,488 --> 00:20:32,924
Nothing. Not a hint. Absolutely nothing.

154
00:20:33,926 --> 00:20:38,124
Even Sollozzo's people don't know
where the meeting will be held.

155
00:20:38,264 --> 00:20:41,097
How much time do we have?

156
00:20:41,233 --> 00:20:46,034
They're going to pick you up outside
Jack Dempsey's in an hour and a half.

157
00:20:47,406 --> 00:20:52,366
- We could put a tail on them.
- Sollozzo would lose our ass.

158
00:20:53,512 --> 00:20:58,074
- What about the negotiator?
- He's playing pinochle with my men.

159
00:20:58,217 --> 00:21:03,177
- He's happy. They're letting him win.
- Too risky. Maybe we should call it off.

160
00:21:03,322 --> 00:21:06,849
The negotiator plays cards
until Mike is back safe.

161
00:21:06,993 --> 00:21:10,759
- He could blast whoever is in the car.
- They'll expect that.

162
00:21:10,896 --> 00:21:14,229
Sollozzo might not even be
in the car, Sonny!

163
00:21:14,367 --> 00:21:15,698
I'll get it.

164
00:21:41,127 --> 00:21:43,425
Louis' restaurant in the Bronx.

165
00:21:43,562 --> 00:21:46,326
- Is it reliable?
- My man in McCluskey's precinct.

166
00:21:46,465 --> 00:21:52,461
A police captain is on call 24 hours
a day. He'll be there between 8 and 1 0.

167
00:21:52,605 --> 00:21:57,338
- Anybody know this joint?
- Sure, I do. It's perfect for us.

168
00:21:57,476 --> 00:22:02,573
A small family place, good food.
Everyone minds his business. Perfect.

169
00:22:03,382 --> 00:22:08,752
They've got an old-fashioned toilet.
You know, the box and the chain thing.

170
00:22:10,489 --> 00:22:12,957
We might be able to tape the gun
behind it.

171
00:22:13,626 --> 00:22:17,756
All right. Mike, you go to the restaurant,

172
00:22:17,897 --> 00:22:21,833
you eat, talk for a while, you relax.
Make them relax.

173
00:22:21,967 --> 00:22:27,132
Then you go to take a leak. No, better
still, you ask permission to go.

174
00:22:27,273 --> 00:22:31,903
Then you come back blasting.
Two shots in the head apiece.

175
00:22:33,446 --> 00:22:35,971
I want somebody very good
to plant that gun.

176
00:22:36,115 --> 00:22:39,084
I don't want him coming out
with just his dick.

177
00:22:39,518 --> 00:22:45,184
- The gun will be there.
- You drive him and pick him up.

178
00:22:45,324 --> 00:22:47,724
Let's move.

179
00:22:52,531 --> 00:22:55,591
Did he tell you to drop the gun
right away?

180
00:22:55,734 --> 00:22:57,634
Yeah, a million times.

181
00:23:02,408 --> 00:23:06,936
Don't forget. Two shots apiece in
the head as soon as you come out.

182
00:23:13,119 --> 00:23:16,316
How long do you think it will be
before I can come back?

183
00:23:17,690 --> 00:23:19,681
At least a year.

184
00:23:19,825 --> 00:23:24,956
I'll square it with Mom, that you're not
seeing her before you leave and...

185
00:23:26,132 --> 00:23:29,590
I'll get a message to that girlfriend
when the time is right.

186
00:23:35,774 --> 00:23:37,537
Take care.

187
00:23:40,412 --> 00:23:42,175
Take care, Mike.

188
00:24:14,680 --> 00:24:18,480
I'm glad you came. I hope we can
straighten everything out.

189
00:24:19,752 --> 00:24:24,689
It's not the way I wanted things to go.
It should never have happened.

190
00:24:24,823 --> 00:24:29,123
I want to straighten everything out.
I don't want my father bothered again.

191
00:24:29,261 --> 00:24:32,526
I swear on my children
that he won't be, Mike.

192
00:24:33,599 --> 00:24:36,762
But you have to keep an open mind
when we talk.

193
00:24:36,902 --> 00:24:42,568
I hope you're not a hothead like Sonny.
You can't talk business with him.

194
00:24:42,708 --> 00:24:44,869
He's a good kid.

195
00:24:48,881 --> 00:24:52,408
I'm sorry about the other night, Mike.

196
00:24:52,551 --> 00:24:56,954
I've got to frisk you, so turn around.
On your knees, facing me.

197
00:25:01,527 --> 00:25:06,260
I guess I'm getting too old for my job.
Too grouchy.

198
00:25:07,533 --> 00:25:11,469
Can't stand the aggravation.
You know how it is.

199
00:25:13,806 --> 00:25:14,898
He's clean.

200
00:25:41,934 --> 00:25:44,198
Going to Jersey?

201
00:25:46,705 --> 00:25:48,263
Maybe.

202
00:26:13,532 --> 00:26:15,591
Nice work, Lou.

203
00:26:52,271 --> 00:26:57,937
- How's the food in this restaurant?
- Try the veal. It's the best in the city.

204
00:26:58,077 --> 00:26:59,738
I'll have it.

205
00:27:35,247 --> 00:27:38,580
- I'm going to speak Italian to Mikey.
- Go ahead.

206
00:28:57,963 --> 00:28:59,692
What I want...

207
00:29:00,833 --> 00:29:03,358
What's most important to me...

208
00:29:05,604 --> 00:29:09,836
...is that I have a guarantee.
No more attempts on my father's life.

209
00:29:09,975 --> 00:29:14,173
What guarantees can I give you?
I'm the hunted one!

210
00:29:14,813 --> 00:29:17,839
I missed my chance.
You think too much of me, kid.

211
00:29:18,417 --> 00:29:20,146
I'm not that clever.

212
00:29:21,787 --> 00:29:24,017
All I want is a truce.

213
00:29:30,662 --> 00:29:34,291
I have to go to the bathroom.
Is it all right?

214
00:29:35,834 --> 00:29:37,301
When you got to go, you got to go.

215
00:29:43,742 --> 00:29:45,266
He's clean.

216
00:29:45,911 --> 00:29:47,970
Don't take too long.

217
00:29:51,250 --> 00:29:52,842
I've frisked a thousand punks.

218
00:34:43,642 --> 00:34:45,610
Okay, you take over.

219
00:35:02,894 --> 00:35:04,953
I love you, Grandpa.

220
00:35:07,432 --> 00:35:10,424
I'm sorry, Pa. He doesn't know you yet.

221
00:35:11,503 --> 00:35:14,597
- Hey, big guy. Give it to Grandpa.
- Okay.

222
00:35:14,739 --> 00:35:21,076
"I hope you get well, Grandpa, and wish
I see you soon. Your grandson Frank."

223
00:35:24,182 --> 00:35:26,241
Go with your mother.

224
00:35:26,384 --> 00:35:28,511
Take them downstairs.

225
00:35:34,459 --> 00:35:36,984
Go on, Carlo, you too.

226
00:35:38,430 --> 00:35:40,125
Go on.

227
00:36:00,685 --> 00:36:04,348
- What's the matter with you, Carlo?
- Shut up and set the table.

228
00:36:20,205 --> 00:36:26,337
Since McCluskey's killing, the police
have cracked down on our operations.

229
00:36:27,979 --> 00:36:32,814
And also the other families.
There's been a lot of bad blood.

230
00:36:32,951 --> 00:36:36,443
They hit us, so we hit them back.

231
00:36:37,289 --> 00:36:41,783
Through our newspaper contacts
we've been able to put out material

232
00:36:41,927 --> 00:36:46,159
about McCluskey's link with Sollozzo
in the drug rackets.

233
00:36:46,298 --> 00:36:48,357
So things are loosening up.

234
00:36:49,634 --> 00:36:57,006
And I sent Fredo to Las Vegas, under
the protection of Don Francesco of L.A.

235
00:36:57,142 --> 00:37:02,239
- I want him to rest.
- I'm going to learn the casino business.

236
00:37:09,955 --> 00:37:11,946
Where's Michael?

237
00:37:24,069 --> 00:37:27,368
It was Michael who killed Sollozzo.

238
00:37:29,007 --> 00:37:33,103
But he's safe. We're starting to work
to bring him back.

239
00:37:54,566 --> 00:37:59,060
Did you find out where that old pimp
Tattaglia is hiding? I want him now.

240
00:37:59,204 --> 00:38:02,298
Sonny, things are starting to loosen up.

241
00:38:02,440 --> 00:38:07,070
If you go after Tattaglia, all hell
will break loose. Pop can negotiate.

242
00:38:07,212 --> 00:38:13,242
- He must get better first. I'll decide...
- War is costly. We can't do business.

243
00:38:13,385 --> 00:38:17,185
- Neither can they. Don't worry about it!
- We can't afford a stalemate.

244
00:38:17,322 --> 00:38:22,385
- No more stalemate. I'll kill the bastard!
- You're getting a great reputation!

245
00:38:22,527 --> 00:38:28,363
Do as I say! If I had a Sicilian wartime
consigliere, I wouldn't be in this shape!

246
00:38:28,500 --> 00:38:30,798
Pop had Genco. Look what I got.

247
00:38:34,205 --> 00:38:36,503
I'm sorry. I didn't mean that.

248
00:38:37,842 --> 00:38:40,811
Ma made a little dinner. It's Sunday.

249
00:38:41,613 --> 00:38:46,050
Niggers are having a good time
with our policy banks in Harlem.

250
00:38:46,184 --> 00:38:50,211
Driving new Cadillacs,
paying 50 per cent on a bet.

251
00:38:50,355 --> 00:38:53,654
That's because they've started
making big money.

252
00:38:53,792 --> 00:38:57,228
Poppa never talked business
at the table.

253
00:38:57,362 --> 00:39:01,093
- Shut up, Connie...
- Don't you ever tell her to shut up.

254
00:39:02,100 --> 00:39:03,795
Don't interfere.

255
00:39:05,170 --> 00:39:09,231
I'd like to talk to you after dinner.
I could do more for the family...

256
00:39:09,374 --> 00:39:12,343
We don't discuss business at the table.

257
00:39:59,290 --> 00:40:01,758
I kiss your hand, Don Tommasino.

258
00:40:07,665 --> 00:40:09,656
Why are you so far
from the house?

259
00:40:10,335 --> 00:40:12,565
You know I'm responsible to your
father for your life.

260
00:40:12,704 --> 00:40:14,831
The bodyguards are here.

261
00:40:14,973 --> 00:40:17,407
It's still dangerous...

262
00:40:17,542 --> 00:40:20,306
We've heard from Santino
in New York...

263
00:40:20,445 --> 00:40:23,778
Your enemies know you're here.

264
00:40:23,915 --> 00:40:27,146
Did Santino say when
I can go back?

265
00:40:27,285 --> 00:40:29,082
Not yet.

266
00:40:29,220 --> 00:40:32,053
It's out of the question.

267
00:40:34,959 --> 00:40:37,689
Where are you going now?

268
00:40:39,097 --> 00:40:41,930
Take my car.

269
00:40:43,501 --> 00:40:45,833
I want to walk.

270
00:40:47,906 --> 00:40:49,737
Be careful.

271
00:41:23,174 --> 00:41:24,869
Where have all the men gone?

272
00:41:25,009 --> 00:41:27,773
They're all dead from vendettas.

273
00:41:30,248 --> 00:41:33,046
There are the names of the dead.

274
00:41:48,433 --> 00:41:52,301
Hey, hey, take me to the America, G.I.!

275
00:41:52,437 --> 00:41:56,840
Hey, hey, take me to the America, G.I.!
Clark Gable!

276
00:41:56,975 --> 00:42:02,413
America! Take me to the America, G.I.!
Clark Gable, Rita Hayworth!

277
00:42:20,131 --> 00:42:22,122
Mamma mia what a beauty.

278
00:42:31,342 --> 00:42:33,742
I think you got hit
by the thunderbolt.

279
00:42:38,816 --> 00:42:43,981
In Sicily women are more
dangerous than shotguns.

280
00:43:07,278 --> 00:43:09,246
Did you have a good hunt?

281
00:43:09,380 --> 00:43:12,042
You know all the girls
around here?

282
00:43:12,183 --> 00:43:14,674
We saw some real beauties.

283
00:43:14,819 --> 00:43:19,256
One of them struck our friend
like a thunderbolt.

284
00:43:21,492 --> 00:43:25,553
She would tempt the devil himself.

285
00:43:31,169 --> 00:43:34,605
Really put together.

286
00:43:37,975 --> 00:43:41,138
Such hair, such mouth!

287
00:43:43,114 --> 00:43:46,743
The girls around here are
beautiful... but virtuous.

288
00:43:46,884 --> 00:43:49,478
This one had a purple dress...

289
00:43:49,620 --> 00:43:52,316
And a purple ribbon in her hair.

290
00:43:52,457 --> 00:43:56,587
A type more Greek than Italian.

291
00:43:58,229 --> 00:44:00,959
Do you know her?

292
00:44:04,402 --> 00:44:07,803
There's no girl like that
in this town.

293
00:44:09,807 --> 00:44:12,537
My God, I understand!

294
00:44:15,780 --> 00:44:17,941
What's wrong?

295
00:44:19,417 --> 00:44:21,317
Let's go.

296
00:44:22,220 --> 00:44:23,619
It's his daughter.

297
00:44:23,755 --> 00:44:26,087
Tell him to come here.

298
00:44:28,393 --> 00:44:29,951
Call him.

299
00:44:50,014 --> 00:44:52,642
Fabrizio, you translate.

300
00:44:56,354 --> 00:44:59,255
I apologise if I offended you.

301
00:44:59,390 --> 00:45:02,553
I'm a stranger in this country.

302
00:45:02,693 --> 00:45:06,151
I meant no disrespect
to you or your daughter.

303
00:45:11,335 --> 00:45:14,566
I'm an American, hiding in Sicily.

304
00:45:15,573 --> 00:45:17,871
My name is Michael Corleone.

305
00:45:19,777 --> 00:45:23,873
There are people who'd pay a lot
of money for that information.

306
00:45:26,184 --> 00:45:29,244
But then your daughter
would lose a father...

307
00:45:30,755 --> 00:45:33,588
...instead of gaining a husband.

308
00:45:41,432 --> 00:45:44,162
I want to meet your daughter.

309
00:45:44,302 --> 00:45:48,864
With your permission, and under
the supervision of your family.

310
00:45:49,540 --> 00:45:51,405
With all respect.

311
00:45:57,515 --> 00:46:03,112
Come to my house Sunday morning.
My name is Vitelli.

312
00:46:07,658 --> 00:46:10,855
What's her name?

313
00:49:03,734 --> 00:49:05,895
I'll knock you dizzy.

314
00:49:11,642 --> 00:49:13,735
Save it for the library.

315
00:49:17,214 --> 00:49:19,842
We've got to pick up my sister.

316
00:49:38,069 --> 00:49:39,627
What's the matter?

317
00:49:42,273 --> 00:49:44,070
What's the matter?

318
00:49:45,843 --> 00:49:48,107
- It was my fault!
- Where is he?

319
00:49:48,245 --> 00:49:51,078
It was my fault. I hit him.

320
00:49:51,215 --> 00:49:54,981
I started a fight with him.
I hit him, so he hit me...

321
00:49:59,223 --> 00:50:03,159
I'm just going to get a doctor
to take a look at you.

322
00:50:03,294 --> 00:50:06,286
Sonny, please don't do anything.

323
00:50:07,932 --> 00:50:09,923
What's the matter with you?
What am I going to do?

324
00:50:10,067 --> 00:50:12,934
Make that baby an orphan
before he's born?

325
00:50:17,575 --> 00:50:20,373
You spic slobs still betting Yankees?

326
00:50:20,911 --> 00:50:24,210
Tell them to stop taking in action.

327
00:50:24,348 --> 00:50:26,145
We lost enough money last week.

328
00:50:33,224 --> 00:50:34,782
Come here, come here!

329
00:51:32,149 --> 00:51:35,516
If you touch my sister again, I'll kill you.

330
00:55:28,752 --> 00:55:32,916
Hey! We weren't expecting you, Kay.
You should call.

331
00:55:33,057 --> 00:55:37,391
Yes, I have. I've tried writing and calling.

332
00:55:37,528 --> 00:55:41,294
- I want to reach Michael.
- Nobody knows where he is.

333
00:55:41,432 --> 00:55:43,957
All we know is that he's all right.

334
00:55:46,537 --> 00:55:50,234
- What was that?
- An accident, but nobody was hurt.

335
00:55:51,241 --> 00:55:56,611
Tom, will you give this letter to Michael.
Please?

336
00:55:56,747 --> 00:56:02,583
If I accepted that, a court could prove
I have knowledge of his whereabouts.

337
00:56:02,719 --> 00:56:04,778
He'll get in touch with you.

338
00:56:04,922 --> 00:56:08,722
I let my cab go, so can I call
another one, please?

339
00:56:08,859 --> 00:56:10,724
Come on. Sorry.

340
00:56:27,711 --> 00:56:33,308
- Hello?
- Is Carlo there?

341
00:56:33,450 --> 00:56:35,782
- Who is this?
- A friend of Carlo.

342
00:56:35,919 --> 00:56:39,650
Tell him that I can't make it tonight
until later.

343
00:56:45,129 --> 00:56:46,391
Bitch!

344
00:56:48,532 --> 00:56:51,023
- Dinner's on the table.
- I'm not hungry.

345
00:56:51,168 --> 00:56:54,433
- The food is getting cold.
- I'll eat out later.

346
00:56:54,571 --> 00:56:57,631
You just told me to make you dinner!

347
00:57:05,349 --> 00:57:08,147
She has a filthy mouth, this Guinea brat.

348
00:57:12,456 --> 00:57:16,825
That's it, break it all, you spoiled
Guinea brat. Break it all!

349
00:57:26,003 --> 00:57:30,269
Why don't you bring your whore
home for dinner?

350
00:57:30,407 --> 00:57:32,068
Maybe I will.

351
00:57:38,415 --> 00:57:41,612
- Clean it up!
- Like hell I will!

352
00:57:41,685 --> 00:57:45,849
You skinny, spoiled brat.
Clean it up! Clean it up!

353
00:57:45,989 --> 00:57:49,857
Clean it up! I said, clean it up!
Clean it up!

354
00:57:52,596 --> 00:57:55,565
Clean it up. Clean that up, you...

355
00:57:58,435 --> 00:58:00,027
Clean it!

356
00:58:00,170 --> 00:58:04,470
Clean it up! Yeah, kill me.
Be a murderer, like your father!

357
00:58:04,608 --> 00:58:06,701
- All you Corleones are murderers!
- I hate you!

358
00:58:06,843 --> 00:58:09,641
Come on, kill me!
