1
00:00:00,006 --> 00:00:00,164
Get out of here!

2
00:00:00,308 --> 00:00:03,675
- I hate you!
- Now I'll kill you.

3
00:00:03,811 --> 00:00:07,042
You Guinea brat. Get out of here!

4
00:00:17,024 --> 00:00:20,152
Connie, what's the matter?
I can't hear you.

5
00:00:21,162 --> 00:00:24,097
Connie, talk louder. The baby's crying.

6
00:00:24,232 --> 00:00:27,167
Santino, I can't understand.
I don't know.

7
00:00:28,402 --> 00:00:30,165
Yeah, Connie.

8
00:00:35,309 --> 00:00:37,641
You wait there.

9
00:00:39,614 --> 00:00:42,447
No, you just wait there.

10
00:00:44,318 --> 00:00:46,878
Son-of-a-bitch.

11
00:00:47,021 --> 00:00:50,388
- Son-of-a-bitch!
- What's the matter?

12
00:00:53,828 --> 00:00:57,093
Open the goddamn gate!
Get off your ass.

13
00:01:04,972 --> 00:01:06,098
Sonny!

14
00:01:12,947 --> 00:01:15,745
- Sonny.
- Get out of here!

15
00:01:15,883 --> 00:01:17,874
Go after him, go on!

16
00:01:47,348 --> 00:01:49,714
Son-of-a-bitch. Come on!

17
00:03:38,259 --> 00:03:40,523
Give me a drop.

18
00:03:48,369 --> 00:03:50,929
My wife is crying upstairs.

19
00:03:53,074 --> 00:03:55,804
I hear cars coming to the house.

20
00:04:00,081 --> 00:04:03,244
Consigliere of mine,

21
00:04:03,384 --> 00:04:06,615
tell your Don what everyone
seems to know.

22
00:04:06,754 --> 00:04:09,120
I didn't tell Mama anything.

23
00:04:10,224 --> 00:04:13,955
I was about to come up and wake you
and tell you.

24
00:04:16,931 --> 00:04:19,024
But you needed a drink first.

25
00:04:21,736 --> 00:04:22,964
Yeah.

26
00:04:25,940 --> 00:04:28,431
Well, now you've had your drink.

27
00:04:34,014 --> 00:04:38,383
They shot Sonny on the causeway.
He's dead.

28
00:04:55,503 --> 00:04:58,438
I want no inquiries made.

29
00:05:02,143 --> 00:05:04,668
I want no acts of vengeance.

30
00:05:06,180 --> 00:05:09,013
I want you to arrange a meeting...

31
00:05:10,084 --> 00:05:13,053
...with the heads of the five families.

32
00:05:14,688 --> 00:05:17,054
This war stops now.

33
00:05:38,679 --> 00:05:41,147
Call Bonasera.

34
00:05:41,282 --> 00:05:43,443
I need him now.

35
00:05:55,663 --> 00:06:00,760
This is Tom Hagen. I'm calling for
Vito Corleone, at his request.

36
00:06:00,901 --> 00:06:03,233
You owe your Don a service.

37
00:06:03,370 --> 00:06:06,999
He has no doubt that you will repay it.

38
00:06:07,141 --> 00:06:11,669
He will be at your funeral parlour
in one hour. Be there to greet him.

39
00:06:32,633 --> 00:06:37,400
Well, my friend, are you ready
to do me this service?

40
00:06:37,538 --> 00:06:41,030
Yes. What do you want me to do?

41
00:06:49,016 --> 00:06:53,851
I want you to use all your powers
and all your skills.

42
00:06:57,725 --> 00:07:00,819
I don't want his mother
to see him this way.

43
00:07:16,744 --> 00:07:19,838
Look how they massacred my boy.

44
00:07:50,077 --> 00:07:52,238
It's safer to teach you English!

45
00:07:52,379 --> 00:07:53,778
I know English...

46
00:07:53,914 --> 00:07:59,409
Monday, Tuesday, Thursday,
Wednesday, Friday, Sunday, Saturday.

47
00:08:06,760 --> 00:08:09,092
Greetings, Don Tommasino.

48
00:08:09,229 --> 00:08:11,891
How are things in Palermo?

49
00:08:17,004 --> 00:08:23,239
Michael is teaching me to
drive... watch, I'll show you.

50
00:08:23,377 --> 00:08:26,039
How are things in Palermo?

51
00:08:26,180 --> 00:08:29,172
Young people don't respect
anything any more...

52
00:08:29,316 --> 00:08:32,342
times are changing for the worse.

53
00:08:34,221 --> 00:08:41,491
This place has become
too dangerous for you.

54
00:08:41,628 --> 00:08:48,727
I want you to move to a villa
near Siracusa... right now.

55
00:08:52,306 --> 00:08:54,968
What's wrong?

56
00:08:55,109 --> 00:08:58,840
Bad news from America.

57
00:08:58,979 --> 00:09:03,882
Your brother, Santino,
they killed him.

58
00:09:08,922 --> 00:09:12,380
Let's go... you promised.

59
00:09:31,111 --> 00:09:33,841
Get the car.

60
00:09:34,715 --> 00:09:38,708
Are you driving yourself, Boss?
Is your wife coming with you?

61
00:09:38,852 --> 00:09:42,379
No, take her to her father's house
until things are safe.

62
00:09:42,523 --> 00:09:44,923
Okay, anything you say.

63
00:09:50,764 --> 00:09:53,232
Calo, where is Apollonia?

64
00:09:53,367 --> 00:09:57,497
She's going to surprise you.
She wants to drive.

65
00:09:59,173 --> 00:10:02,074
She'll make a good American wife.

66
00:10:03,077 --> 00:10:05,136
Wait, I'll get the baggage.

67
00:10:15,089 --> 00:10:17,421
Fabrizio!

68
00:10:17,558 --> 00:10:20,026
Where are you going?

69
00:10:20,160 --> 00:10:23,687
Wait there! I'll drive to you.

70
00:10:29,236 --> 00:10:30,567
No, Apollonia!

71
00:10:53,894 --> 00:10:59,491
Don Barzini, I want to thank you
for helping me organise this meeting,

72
00:10:59,633 --> 00:11:04,798
and the other heads of the five families
from New York and New Jersey.

73
00:11:06,406 --> 00:11:09,466
Carmine Cuneo from the Bronx,

74
00:11:09,610 --> 00:11:12,943
and from Brooklyn...

75
00:11:14,681 --> 00:11:16,774
...Philip Tattaglia.

76
00:11:18,285 --> 00:11:21,311
And from Staten Island

77
00:11:21,455 --> 00:11:24,618
we have with us Victor Strachi.

78
00:11:24,758 --> 00:11:30,663
And the other associates that came as
far as from California and Kansas City

79
00:11:30,797 --> 00:11:34,528
and all the other territories
of the country. Thank you.

80
00:11:41,141 --> 00:11:44,599
How did things ever get so far?

81
00:11:44,745 --> 00:11:46,372
I don't know.

82
00:11:48,382 --> 00:11:52,318
It was so unfortunate, so unnecessary.

83
00:11:54,855 --> 00:11:58,985
Tattaglia lost a son, and I lost a son.

84
00:12:00,894 --> 00:12:04,227
We're quits. And if Tattaglia agrees,

85
00:12:04,364 --> 00:12:08,357
then I'm willing to let things go on
as before.

86
00:12:09,870 --> 00:12:13,397
We're grateful to Don Corleone
for calling this meeting.

87
00:12:13,540 --> 00:12:18,876
We all know him as a man of his word.
A modest man who listens to reason.

88
00:12:19,012 --> 00:12:23,005
Yes, Don Barzini. He's too modest.

89
00:12:23,150 --> 00:12:27,348
He had all the judges and politicians
in his pocket.

90
00:12:27,487 --> 00:12:30,354
He refused to share them.

91
00:12:30,490 --> 00:12:34,221
When did I ever refuse
an accommodation?

92
00:12:34,361 --> 00:12:36,659
All of you know me.

93
00:12:37,664 --> 00:12:42,829
When did I ever refuse,
except one time? And why?

94
00:12:44,504 --> 00:12:50,238
Because I believe this drug business
will destroy us in the years to come.

95
00:12:50,377 --> 00:12:54,211
It's not like gambling or liquor
or even women,

96
00:12:54,348 --> 00:13:00,651
which is something that most people
want, but is forbidden by the Church.

97
00:13:00,787 --> 00:13:05,315
Even the police that have helped us in
the past with gambling and other things

98
00:13:05,459 --> 00:13:09,793
are going to refuse to help us
when it comes to narcotics.

99
00:13:09,930 --> 00:13:14,924
I believed that then...
and I believe that now.

100
00:13:15,068 --> 00:13:17,195
Times have changed.

101
00:13:17,337 --> 00:13:22,070
It's not like the old days,
when we could do anything we wanted.

102
00:13:22,209 --> 00:13:25,076
A refusal is not the act of a friend.

103
00:13:25,212 --> 00:13:30,616
If Don Corleone had all the judges and
politicians, then he must share them

104
00:13:30,751 --> 00:13:35,620
or let others use them. He must let us
draw the water from the well.

105
00:13:36,356 --> 00:13:39,917
Certainly he can present a bill
for such services.

106
00:13:40,060 --> 00:13:42,961
After all, we're not communists.

107
00:13:45,799 --> 00:13:48,825
I also don't believe in drugs.

108
00:13:48,969 --> 00:13:53,633
For years I paid my people extra, so
they wouldn't do that kind of business.

109
00:13:53,774 --> 00:13:56,937
Somebody says to them
"I have powders."

110
00:13:57,077 --> 00:14:03,505
"If you put up 3-4,000 dollar investment,
we can make 50,000 distributing."

111
00:14:04,551 --> 00:14:10,319
They can't resist. I want to control it
as a business, keep it respectable.

112
00:14:10,991 --> 00:14:15,485
I don't want it near schools,
I don't want it sold to children.

113
00:14:15,629 --> 00:14:17,597
That's an infàmia.

114
00:14:18,632 --> 00:14:22,591
In my city we would keep the traffic
to the coloured.

115
00:14:22,736 --> 00:14:25,705
They're animals,
so let them lose their souls.

116
00:14:32,512 --> 00:14:36,448
I hoped that we could come here
and reason together.

117
00:14:37,517 --> 00:14:44,446
And I'm willing to do whatever is
necessary to find a peaceful solution.

118
00:14:44,591 --> 00:14:49,085
We are agreed. The traffic in drugs
will be permitted, but controlled.

119
00:14:49,229 --> 00:14:53,666
Don Corleone will give us protection
in the east, and there will be peace.

120
00:14:53,800 --> 00:14:57,463
I must have strict assurance
from Corleone.

121
00:14:57,604 --> 00:15:00,937
As time goes by and his position
becomes stronger,

122
00:15:01,074 --> 00:15:03,304
will he attempt any individual vendetta?

123
00:15:03,443 --> 00:15:09,109
We are all reasonable men.
We don't have to give assurances.

124
00:15:09,249 --> 00:15:11,410
You talk about vengeance.

125
00:15:11,551 --> 00:15:14,782
Will vengeance bring your son
back to you?

126
00:15:14,921 --> 00:15:17,719
Or my boy to me?

127
00:15:17,858 --> 00:15:20,759
I forgo the vengeance of my son.

128
00:15:23,530 --> 00:15:25,964
But I have selfish reasons.

129
00:15:28,034 --> 00:15:32,027
My youngest son was forced
to leave this country...

130
00:15:33,507 --> 00:15:36,135
...because of this Sollozzo business.

131
00:15:37,844 --> 00:15:41,336
And I have to make arrangements
to bring him back here safely.

132
00:15:41,481 --> 00:15:44,279
Cleared of all these false charges.

133
00:15:45,719 --> 00:15:48,779
But I'm a superstitious man.

134
00:15:48,922 --> 00:15:55,521
If an unlucky accident should befall him,
if he should be shot by a police officer,

135
00:15:55,662 --> 00:15:59,223
or if he should hang himself
in his jail cell,

136
00:15:59,366 --> 00:16:02,096
or if he's struck by a bolt of lightning,

137
00:16:03,470 --> 00:16:06,962
then I'm going to blame
some of the people in this room.

138
00:16:08,642 --> 00:16:10,974
And that I do not forgive.

139
00:16:13,513 --> 00:16:15,879
But, that aside...

140
00:16:18,985 --> 00:16:21,351
...let me say that I swear...

141
00:16:22,923 --> 00:16:26,051
...on the souls of my grandchildren,

142
00:16:26,193 --> 00:16:30,152
that I will not be the one to break
the peace we've made here today.

143
00:16:56,022 --> 00:17:01,426
Should I insist that all of Tattaglia's
drug middlemen have clean records?

144
00:17:01,561 --> 00:17:04,086
Mention it. Don't insist.

145
00:17:05,799 --> 00:17:10,702
- Barzini will know without being told.
- You mean Tattaglia.

146
00:17:12,405 --> 00:17:17,604
Tattaglia's a pimp. He could never
have outfought Santino.

147
00:17:21,081 --> 00:17:27,077
But I didn't know until this day
that it was Barzini all along.

148
00:17:41,935 --> 00:17:44,028
Come on, Nancy.

149
00:17:45,238 --> 00:17:47,798
Keep together, everyone. Brian.

150
00:17:49,142 --> 00:17:51,201
Okay, all right.

151
00:18:04,090 --> 00:18:05,682
How long have you been back?

152
00:18:06,826 --> 00:18:08,657
I've been back a year.

153
00:18:10,196 --> 00:18:12,858
Longer than that, I think.

154
00:18:14,868 --> 00:18:17,200
It's good to see you, Kay.

155
00:18:28,181 --> 00:18:30,741
I'm working for my father now, Kay.

156
00:18:33,186 --> 00:18:36,246
He's been sick. Very sick.

157
00:18:37,857 --> 00:18:44,228
But you're not like him. You told me you
weren't going to become like your father.

158
00:18:45,632 --> 00:18:49,830
My father is no different
than any other powerful man.

159
00:18:49,970 --> 00:18:53,531
Any man who's responsible
for other people.

160
00:18:54,674 --> 00:18:57,040
Like a senator or president.

161
00:18:57,177 --> 00:18:59,577
- How naive you sound.
- Why?

162
00:18:59,713 --> 00:19:02,546
They don't have men killed.

163
00:19:05,719 --> 00:19:07,710
Who's being naive, Kay?

164
00:19:08,989 --> 00:19:13,790
My father's way of doing things is over.
Even he knows that.

165
00:19:14,794 --> 00:19:19,288
In five years the Corleone family
is going to be completely legitimate.

166
00:19:21,001 --> 00:19:24,960
Trust me. That's all I can tell you
about my business. Kay...

167
00:19:26,406 --> 00:19:30,706
Michael, why did you come here? Why?

168
00:19:30,844 --> 00:19:35,543
What do you want with me after all
this time? I've been calling and writing.

169
00:19:35,682 --> 00:19:39,140
I came because I need you.
I care for you.

170
00:19:39,285 --> 00:19:43,517
- Please stop it, Michael.
- Because... I want you to marry me.

171
00:19:44,924 --> 00:19:47,893
- It's too late.
- Please, Kay...

172
00:19:49,162 --> 00:19:53,121
I'll do anything you ask to make up for
what's happened to us.

173
00:19:54,934 --> 00:19:59,564
Because that's important, Kay.
Because what's important is that...

174
00:20:00,740 --> 00:20:04,232
...we have each other.
That we have a life together.

175
00:20:05,578 --> 00:20:08,376
That we have children. Our children.

176
00:20:09,816 --> 00:20:12,376
Kay, I need you.

177
00:20:14,054 --> 00:20:16,249
And I love you.

178
00:20:37,610 --> 00:20:41,376
Barzini's people chisel my territory
and we do nothing about it!

179
00:20:41,514 --> 00:20:45,075
- Soon I'll have no place to hang my hat!
- Be patient.

180
00:20:45,218 --> 00:20:48,278
I'm not asking for help.
Just take off the handcuffs.

181
00:20:48,421 --> 00:20:51,720
- Be patient.
- We must protect ourselves.

182
00:20:51,858 --> 00:20:55,225
- Let me recruit some new men.
- No.

183
00:20:55,361 --> 00:20:59,422
- Barzini would get an excuse to fight.
- Mike, you're wrong.

184
00:21:00,567 --> 00:21:02,694
Don Corleone...

185
00:21:02,836 --> 00:21:06,897
You once said that one day Tessio
and me could form our own family.

186
00:21:07,040 --> 00:21:11,477
Till today I would never think of it.
I must ask your permission.

187
00:21:12,078 --> 00:21:14,706
Michael is now head of the family.

188
00:21:14,848 --> 00:21:19,046
If he gives his permission,
then you have my blessing.

189
00:21:19,185 --> 00:21:21,483
After we make the move to Nevada

190
00:21:21,621 --> 00:21:26,024
you can leave the Corleone family
and go on your own.

191
00:21:26,159 --> 00:21:30,459
- How long will that be?
- Six months.

192
00:21:30,597 --> 00:21:36,797
Forgive me, but with you gone, me and
Pete will come under Barzini's thumb.

193
00:21:36,936 --> 00:21:42,533
I hate that Barzini. In six months' time
there will be nothing left to build on.

194
00:21:42,675 --> 00:21:45,542
- Do you have faith in my judgement?
- Yes.

195
00:21:45,678 --> 00:21:48,579
- Do I have your loyalty?
- Always, Godfather.

196
00:21:48,715 --> 00:21:52,446
Then be a friend to Michael.
Do as he says.

197
00:21:56,823 --> 00:22:02,090
Things are negotiated that'll solve your
problems and answer your questions.

198
00:22:02,228 --> 00:22:04,321
That's all I can tell you now.

199
00:22:05,431 --> 00:22:07,831
Carlo, you grew up in Nevada.

200
00:22:07,967 --> 00:22:11,266
When we make our move there,
you'll be my right-hand man.

201
00:22:11,404 --> 00:22:16,341
Tom Hagen is no longer consigliere.
He'll be our lawyer in Vegas.

202
00:22:16,476 --> 00:22:19,843
That's no reflection on Tom,
just how I want it.

203
00:22:19,979 --> 00:22:24,541
If I ever need help, who's a better
consigliere than my father? That's it.

204
00:22:43,803 --> 00:22:47,432
- Thank you, Poppa.
- I'm happy for you, Carlo.

205
00:22:47,574 --> 00:22:50,634
Mike... Why am I out?

206
00:22:52,111 --> 00:22:54,841
You're not a wartime consigliere, Tom.

207
00:22:56,115 --> 00:22:58,777
Things may get rough with the move.

208
00:22:59,452 --> 00:23:00,749
Tom.

209
00:23:05,925 --> 00:23:11,090
I advised Michael. I never thought
you were a bad consigliere.

210
00:23:11,231 --> 00:23:16,669
I thought Santino was a bad Don,
rest in peace.

211
00:23:16,803 --> 00:23:20,034
Michael has all my confidence,
just as you do.

212
00:23:21,040 --> 00:23:26,808
But there are reasons why you must
have no part in what is going to happen.

213
00:23:26,946 --> 00:23:30,347
- Maybe I could help.
- You're out, Tom.

214
00:24:19,365 --> 00:24:23,529
I can't get over the way your face looks.
So good!

215
00:24:23,670 --> 00:24:28,198
This doctor did some job. Did Kay
talk you into it? Hey, hey, hey!

216
00:24:28,341 --> 00:24:32,471
Leave them out here.
He's tired and wants to clean up.

217
00:24:32,612 --> 00:24:34,842
Let me open the door, all right?

218
00:24:41,087 --> 00:24:46,753
- Hello, Mike! Welcome to Las Vegas!
- All for you, kid! It's all his idea.

219
00:24:46,893 --> 00:24:49,691
- Your brother Freddy.
- Girls?

220
00:24:53,232 --> 00:24:57,328
I'll be right back. Keep them occupied.

221
00:24:57,470 --> 00:25:01,099
- Anything you want, kid, anything.
- Who are the girls?

222
00:25:02,375 --> 00:25:05,902
- That's for you to find out.
- Get rid of them, Fredo.

223
00:25:07,313 --> 00:25:11,909
- Hey, Mike...
- I'm here on business. Get rid of them.

224
00:25:12,051 --> 00:25:15,350
I'm tired. Get rid of the band too.

225
00:25:20,626 --> 00:25:23,618
Hey, take off. Take off. Let's go.

226
00:25:24,030 --> 00:25:26,123
Hey, that's it. Hey, Angelo.

227
00:25:27,900 --> 00:25:29,993
Hey, come on! Scram!

228
00:25:31,671 --> 00:25:35,198
Come on, honey. I don't know
what's the matter with him, Johnny.

229
00:25:36,576 --> 00:25:38,407
Sorry.

230
00:25:38,544 --> 00:25:41,069
I don't know. He's tired.

231
00:25:48,121 --> 00:25:51,090
What happened to Moe Greene?

232
00:25:51,224 --> 00:25:55,593
He had some business. He said to
give him a call when the party started.

233
00:25:55,728 --> 00:25:57,855
Well, give him a call.

234
00:25:58,965 --> 00:26:02,264
- Johnny, how are you?
- Nice to see you, Mike.

235
00:26:02,402 --> 00:26:04,370
- We're proud of you.
- Thanks.

236
00:26:04,504 --> 00:26:08,031
Sit down, I want to talk to you.
The Don is proud too.

237
00:26:08,174 --> 00:26:11,143
Well, I owe it all to him.

238
00:26:11,277 --> 00:26:16,408
He knows how grateful you are. That's
why he'd like to ask a favour of you.

239
00:26:16,549 --> 00:26:18,483
Mike, what can I do?

240
00:26:19,719 --> 00:26:25,783
We're thinking of giving up our interests
in the olive oil business and settle here.

241
00:26:25,925 --> 00:26:31,921
Moe will sell us his share of the casino
and the hotel, so we'll own all of it. Tom!

242
00:26:32,065 --> 00:26:37,196
Are you sure? Moe loves the business.
He never said nothing about selling.

243
00:26:37,336 --> 00:26:40,237
I'll make him an offer he can't refuse.

244
00:26:41,374 --> 00:26:43,706
See, Johnny...

245
00:26:43,843 --> 00:26:48,041
We figure that entertainment
would draw gamblers to the casino.

246
00:26:48,181 --> 00:26:51,776
We hope you'll sign a contract
to appear five times a year.

247
00:26:54,787 --> 00:26:59,588
Perhaps convince some of your friends
in the movies to do the same.

248
00:27:00,593 --> 00:27:02,686
We're counting on you.

249
00:27:04,831 --> 00:27:08,699
Sure, Mike. I'll do anything
for my godfather.

250
00:27:08,835 --> 00:27:10,132
Good.

251
00:27:11,604 --> 00:27:16,303
Hey, Mike! Hello, fellows.
Everybody's here. Freddy, Tom.

252
00:27:16,442 --> 00:27:18,740
- Good to see you.
- How are you, Moe?

253
00:27:18,878 --> 00:27:23,906
Have everything? Specially prepared
food, the best dancers, and good credit.

254
00:27:24,050 --> 00:27:27,315
Draw chips for everybody,
so they can play on the house.

255
00:27:30,289 --> 00:27:33,417
Is my credit good enough
to buy you out?

256
00:27:34,861 --> 00:27:36,556
Buy me out?

257
00:27:36,662 --> 00:27:41,656
The casino, the hotel. The
Corleone family wants to buy you out.

258
00:27:42,435 --> 00:27:47,771
The Corleone family wants to
buy me out? No, I buy you out.

259
00:27:47,907 --> 00:27:51,206
Your casino loses money.
We can do better.

260
00:27:51,344 --> 00:27:55,872
- You think I'm skimming off the top?
- You're unlucky.

261
00:28:00,186 --> 00:28:02,552
You Guineas make me laugh.

262
00:28:02,688 --> 00:28:07,489
I took Freddy in when you had a bad
time, and now you try to push me out!

263
00:28:08,594 --> 00:28:11,927
You did that because we bankrolled
your casino

264
00:28:12,064 --> 00:28:17,331
and the Molinari family guaranteed
his safety. Let's talk business.

265
00:28:17,470 --> 00:28:22,737
Yes. First of all, you're all done. You
don't have that kind of muscle anymore.

266
00:28:22,875 --> 00:28:27,278
The Godfather is sick. You're getting
chased out of New York by the others.

267
00:28:27,413 --> 00:28:31,213
Do you think you can come to my hotel
and take over?

268
00:28:31,350 --> 00:28:36,344
I talked to Barzini. I can make a deal
with him and still keep my hotel!

269
00:28:36,489 --> 00:28:39,219
Is that why you slapped my brother
around in public?

270
00:28:40,126 --> 00:28:44,825
That was nothing, Mike.
Moe didn't mean nothing by that.

271
00:28:44,964 --> 00:28:49,162
He flies off the handle sometimes,
but we're good friends.

272
00:28:49,302 --> 00:28:54,001
I have a business to run.
I've got to kick asses sometimes.

273
00:28:54,140 --> 00:28:58,076
We had an argument,
so I had to straighten him out.

274
00:28:58,211 --> 00:29:00,839
You straightened my brother out?

275
00:29:00,980 --> 00:29:05,474
He was banging cocktail waitresses!
Players couldn't get a drink.

276
00:29:05,618 --> 00:29:07,677
What's wrong with you?

277
00:29:12,358 --> 00:29:16,021
I leave for New York tomorrow.
Think about a price.

278
00:29:16,662 --> 00:29:17,959
Son-of-a-bitch!

279
00:29:18,097 --> 00:29:23,364
I'm Moe Greene! I made my bones
when you were out with cheerleaders.

280
00:29:23,502 --> 00:29:25,993
Wait a minute, Moe. I have an idea.

281
00:29:27,006 --> 00:29:30,498
Tom, you're the consigliere.
Talk to the Don...

282
00:29:30,643 --> 00:29:35,876
Just a minute. Don is semi-retired and
Mike is in charge of the family business.

283
00:29:36,015 --> 00:29:39,280
If you have anything to say,
say it to Michael.

284
00:29:43,256 --> 00:29:48,455
Mike, you don't come to Las Vegas and
talk to a man like Moe Greene like that!

285
00:29:50,062 --> 00:29:51,256
Fredo...

286
00:29:52,398 --> 00:29:55,333
You're my older brother, and I love you.

287
00:29:56,669 --> 00:30:00,799
But don't ever take sides with anyone
against the family again.

288
00:30:11,150 --> 00:30:15,519
I have to see my father and his people,
so have dinner without me.

289
00:30:17,189 --> 00:30:22,388
This weekend we'll go out. We'll go to
the city, see a show and have dinner.

290
00:30:29,335 --> 00:30:32,327
Your sister wants to ask you something.

291
00:30:32,471 --> 00:30:34,598
- Let her ask.
- She's afraid to.

292
00:30:34,740 --> 00:30:37,709
They want you to be godfather
to their boy.

293
00:30:37,843 --> 00:30:39,606
- We'll see.
- Will you?

294
00:30:39,745 --> 00:30:41,975
Let me think about it. Come on.

295
00:30:50,790 --> 00:30:53,691
Barzini will move against you first.

296
00:30:53,826 --> 00:30:58,263
He'll set up a meeting with someone
you absolutely trust.

297
00:30:58,397 --> 00:31:00,592
Guaranteeing your safety.

298
00:31:01,600 --> 00:31:05,092
And at that meeting
you'll be assassinated.

299
00:31:09,542 --> 00:31:12,943
I like to drink wine more than I used to.

300
00:31:13,979 --> 00:31:17,745
- Anyway, I'm drinking more.
- It's good for you, Pop.

301
00:31:22,588 --> 00:31:24,078
I don't know.

302
00:31:26,025 --> 00:31:28,926
Are you happy with your wife
and children?

303
00:31:29,929 --> 00:31:33,126
- Very happy.
- That's good.

304
00:31:34,633 --> 00:31:39,468
I hope you don't mind the way I keep
going over this Barzini business.

305
00:31:39,605 --> 00:31:43,006
- No, not at all.
- It's an old habit.

306
00:31:44,009 --> 00:31:46,978
I spend my life trying not to be careless.

307
00:31:48,614 --> 00:31:52,072
Women and children can be careless,
but not men.

308
00:31:55,321 --> 00:31:57,687
- How's your boy?
- He's good.

309
00:31:57,823 --> 00:32:00,951
He looks more like you every day.

310
00:32:03,329 --> 00:32:07,629
He's smarter than I am. He's three
and can read the funny papers.

311
00:32:09,835 --> 00:32:12,030
Read the funny papers.

312
00:32:19,078 --> 00:32:24,778
I want you to arrange for a telephone
man to check all in- And out-going calls.

313
00:32:24,917 --> 00:32:30,685
- I did it already. I took care of that, Pop.
- That's right. I forgot.

314
00:32:34,260 --> 00:32:36,694
What's the matter?

315
00:32:36,829 --> 00:32:38,888
What's bothering you?

316
00:32:42,368 --> 00:32:46,930
I'll handle it. I told you I can handle it,
so I'll handle it.

317
00:33:00,319 --> 00:33:04,756
I knew that Santino would have to
go through all this.

318
00:33:04,890 --> 00:33:06,858
And Fredo...

319
00:33:09,161 --> 00:33:11,629
Fredo was, well...

320
00:33:13,132 --> 00:33:16,397
But I never wanted this for you.

321
00:33:18,237 --> 00:33:23,265
I worked my whole life. I don't apologise
for taking care of my family.

322
00:33:23,409 --> 00:33:27,277
And I refused to be a fool,

323
00:33:27,413 --> 00:33:31,873
dancing on a string
held by all those big shots.

324
00:33:33,519 --> 00:33:36,886
I don't apologise. That's my life,
but I thought that...

325
00:33:38,657 --> 00:33:43,856
...that when it was your time, you would
be the one to hold the strings.

326
00:33:45,598 --> 00:33:51,161
Senator Corleone. Governor Corleone.
Something.

327
00:33:51,303 --> 00:33:54,295
Another pezzo da novanta.

328
00:33:54,440 --> 00:33:56,101
Well...

329
00:33:59,278 --> 00:34:03,214
Just wasn't enough time, Michael.
Wasn't enough time.

330
00:34:03,349 --> 00:34:07,308
We'll get there, Pop. We'll get there.

331
00:34:11,690 --> 00:34:16,093
Now listen, whoever comes to you
with this Barzini meeting,

332
00:34:16,228 --> 00:34:19,720
he's the traitor. Don't forget that.

333
00:34:36,248 --> 00:34:39,012
Can I hold it, please?

334
00:34:53,432 --> 00:34:57,368
- Can I water these?
- Yes, go ahead.

335
00:34:57,503 --> 00:35:00,563
Over here, over here.

336
00:35:02,141 --> 00:35:05,167
Be careful. You're spilling it.

337
00:35:10,950 --> 00:35:12,383
Antony!

338
00:35:12,518 --> 00:35:14,213
Come here, come here.

339
00:35:18,824 --> 00:35:21,486
That's it. We'll put it right there.

340
00:35:27,633 --> 00:35:30,534
I'll show you something. Come here.

341
00:35:32,137 --> 00:35:34,002
Stand there.

342
00:35:37,743 --> 00:35:40,007
Give me an orange!

343
00:35:57,896 --> 00:35:59,887
That's a new trick.

344
00:36:00,933 --> 00:36:03,595
You run in there. Run in there.

345
00:36:16,682 --> 00:36:18,616
Where are you?

346
00:39:16,161 --> 00:39:18,561
Mike, can I have a minute?

347
00:39:28,640 --> 00:39:30,972
Barzini wants to arrange a meeting.

348
00:39:31,109 --> 00:39:34,135
He says we can straighten out
any of our problems.

349
00:39:35,247 --> 00:39:37,681
- You talked to him?
- Yeah.

350
00:39:38,684 --> 00:39:42,882
I can arrange security. On my territory.

351
00:39:45,557 --> 00:39:48,583
- All right?
- All right.

352
00:40:05,677 --> 00:40:08,441
Do you know how they're going to
come at you?

353
00:40:11,149 --> 00:40:15,415
They're arranging a meeting
in Brooklyn. Tessio's ground.

354
00:40:16,922 --> 00:40:18,856
Where I'll be safe.

355
00:40:31,003 --> 00:40:34,564
I always thought it would be
Clemenza, not Tessio.

356
00:40:34,706 --> 00:40:39,075
It's the smart move.
Tessio was always smarter.

357
00:40:40,712 --> 00:40:43,078
But I'm going to wait.

358
00:40:43,215 --> 00:40:45,376
After the baptism.

359
00:40:47,519 --> 00:40:50,215
I've decided to be godfather
to Connie's baby.

360
00:40:51,423 --> 00:40:54,449
And then I'll meet with Don Barzini

361
00:40:54,593 --> 00:40:59,428
and Tattaglia.
All the heads of the five families.

362
00:43:20,806 --> 00:43:25,607
Michael, do you believe in God, the
Father, Creator of Heaven and Earth?

363
00:43:25,744 --> 00:43:26,836
I do.

364
00:43:26,978 --> 00:43:30,573
Do you believe in Jesus Christ,
His only Son, our Lord?

365
00:43:30,715 --> 00:43:31,807
I do.

366
00:43:31,950 --> 00:43:36,011
Do you believe in the Holy Ghost,
the Holy Catholic Church?

367
00:43:36,154 --> 00:43:37,382
I do.

368
00:44:42,888 --> 00:44:47,257
Michael Francis Rizzi,
do you renounce Satan?

369
00:44:53,331 --> 00:44:54,821
I do renounce him.

370
00:45:04,409 --> 00:45:05,933
And all his works?

371
00:45:19,724 --> 00:45:20,816
I do renounce them.

372
00:45:22,561 --> 00:45:23,755
Oh, God!

373
00:45:26,531 --> 00:45:30,490
- And all his pomps?
- I do renounce them.

374
00:45:45,884 --> 00:45:50,253
Michael Rizzi, will you be baptised?

375
00:45:50,388 --> 00:45:51,616
I will.

376
00:45:58,897 --> 00:46:04,836
Michael Rizzi, go in peace, and may
the Lord be with you. Amen.

377
00:46:18,450 --> 00:46:20,350
Kay!

378
00:46:20,485 --> 00:46:22,578
Kiss your godfather.

379
00:46:46,811 --> 00:46:52,579
Can't go to Vegas. Something's come
up. Everybody has to leave without us.

380
00:46:52,717 --> 00:46:56,175
- Mike, it's our first vacation!
- Connie, please.

381
00:46:56,321 --> 00:46:59,518
Go back to the house, wait for my call.
It's important.

382
00:47:00,825 --> 00:47:03,191
I'll only be a couple of days.

383
00:47:19,177 --> 00:47:21,372
We're on our way to Brooklyn.

384
00:47:23,448 --> 00:47:27,646
- I hope Mike can get us a good deal.
- I'm sure he will.

385
00:47:34,993 --> 00:47:40,431
Sal, Tom, the boss says he'll come in a
separate car, so you two go on ahead.

386
00:47:40,565 --> 00:47:44,023
- That screws up my arrangements.
- That's what he said.

387
00:47:44,169 --> 00:47:46,330
I can't go either, Sal.

388
00:47:58,283 --> 00:48:02,982
Tell Mike it was only business.
I always liked him.

389
00:48:03,922 --> 00:48:06,891
- He understands that.
- Excuse me, Sal.

390
00:48:12,764 --> 00:48:15,232
Tom, can you get me off the hook?

391
00:48:16,334 --> 00:48:19,633
- For old times' sake?
- Can't do it, Sally.

392
00:49:05,049 --> 00:49:07,415
You have to answer for Santino, Carlo.

393
00:49:12,557 --> 00:49:16,459
- Mike, you got it all wrong.
- You fingered Sonny for Barzini.

394
00:49:17,662 --> 00:49:21,393
That little farce you played
with my sister.

395
00:49:21,533 --> 00:49:26,766
- You think that could fool a Corleone?
- I'm innocent. I swear on the kids.

396
00:49:26,905 --> 00:49:30,238
- Please, don't do this.
- Sit down.

397
00:49:32,277 --> 00:49:34,745
Don't do this to me, please.

398
00:49:43,788 --> 00:49:45,847
Barzini is dead.

399
00:49:47,525 --> 00:49:49,857
So is Philip Tattaglia.

400
00:49:51,162 --> 00:49:52,629
Moe Greene.

401
00:49:53,598 --> 00:49:58,035
Strachi. Cuneo.

402
00:49:59,270 --> 00:50:03,707
Today I settle all family business,
so don't tell me you're innocent, Carlo.

403
00:50:04,709 --> 00:50:06,870
Admit what you did.

404
00:50:10,315 --> 00:50:12,340
Get him a drink.

405
00:50:18,456 --> 00:50:19,616
Come on.

406
00:50:20,925 --> 00:50:25,828
Don't be afraid, Carlo. Do you think
I'd make my sister a widow?

407
00:50:27,432 --> 00:50:30,367
I'm godfather to your son, Carlo.

408
00:50:37,075 --> 00:50:39,441
Go ahead, drink, drink.

409
00:50:44,015 --> 00:50:47,849
No, you're out of the family business.
That's your punishment.

410
00:50:48,887 --> 00:50:52,789
You're finished.
I'm putting you on a plane to Vegas.

411
00:50:52,924 --> 00:50:54,551
Tom.

412
00:50:58,630 --> 00:51:02,259
I want you to stay there. Understand?

413
00:51:02,400 --> 00:51:05,335
Only don't tell me you're innocent.

414
00:51:06,304 --> 00:51:10,968
Because it insults my intelligence.
Makes me very angry.

415
00:51:14,779 --> 00:51:16,838
Who approached you?

416
00:51:18,049 --> 00:51:20,540
Tattaglia or Barzini?

417
00:51:28,192 --> 00:51:30,956
It was Barzini.

418
00:51:34,065 --> 00:51:35,657
Good.

419
00:51:41,806 --> 00:51:45,799
There's a car waiting outside
to take you to the airport.

420
00:51:45,944 --> 00:51:49,141
I'll call your wife and tell her
what flight you're on.

421
00:51:53,851 --> 00:51:56,649
- Mike...
- Get out of my sight.

422
00:52:22,513 --> 00:52:24,174
Hello, Carlo.

423
00:53:23,741 --> 00:53:27,108
- I'm trying to tell you...
- Mama, please!

424
00:53:35,420 --> 00:53:37,513
Michael!

425
00:53:37,655 --> 00:53:40,647
- What is it?
- Where is he?

426
00:53:42,160 --> 00:53:47,154
Michael, you lousy bastard!
You killed my husband.

427
00:53:47,298 --> 00:53:51,359
You waited until Papa died,
so nobody could stop you.

428
00:53:51,502 --> 00:53:54,471
You blamed him for Sonny.
Everybody did.

429
00:53:54,605 --> 00:54:00,407
But you never thought about me!
Now what are we going to do?

430
00:54:00,545 --> 00:54:02,308
Connie.

431
00:54:04,482 --> 00:54:09,943
Why do you think he kept Carlo at the
Mall? He knew he was going to kill him.

432
00:54:10,088 --> 00:54:15,390
And you stood godfather to our baby.
You lousy cold-hearted bastard!

433
00:54:15,526 --> 00:54:19,519
Want to know how many men he had
killed with Carlo? Read the papers!

434
00:54:19,664 --> 00:54:23,327
That's your husband,
that's your husband!

435
00:54:32,243 --> 00:54:35,804
No! No, no...

436
00:54:36,414 --> 00:54:39,815
Take her upstairs. Get her a doctor.

437
00:55:00,872 --> 00:55:02,601
She's hysterical.

438
00:55:07,345 --> 00:55:09,040
Hysterical.

439
00:55:10,848 --> 00:55:12,110
Michael, is it true?

440
00:55:14,652 --> 00:55:18,247
- Don't ask me about my business, Kay.
- Is it true?

441
00:55:18,389 --> 00:55:21,620
Don't ask me about my business.
Enough!

442
00:55:41,345 --> 00:55:42,835
All right.

443
00:55:45,550 --> 00:55:47,541
This one time.

444
00:55:51,322 --> 00:55:53,916
This one time I'll let you ask me
about my affairs.

445
00:56:00,832 --> 00:56:01,958
Is it true?

446
00:56:06,370 --> 00:56:07,928
Is it?

447
00:56:09,507 --> 00:56:10,940
No.

448
00:56:24,555 --> 00:56:28,184
I guess we both need a drink. Come on.

449
00:56:58,956 --> 00:57:00,821
Don Corleone.
