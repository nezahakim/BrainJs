1
00:00:48,421 --> 00:00:50,116
- Merry Christmas.
- Yeah.

2
00:00:50,222 --> 00:00:53,146
I'm glad I run into you.
I wanna talk to you.

3
00:00:53,259 --> 00:00:55,056
I haven't got time.

4
00:00:55,161 --> 00:00:57,925
Oh, make time, consigliere.
Get in the car.

5
00:01:00,032 --> 00:01:01,522
What are you worried about?

6
00:01:01,634 --> 00:01:03,829
If I wanted to kill you,
you'd be dead already.

7
00:01:04,937 --> 00:01:06,097
Get in.

8
00:01:18,617 --> 00:01:20,710
- I'm gonna buy some fruit.
- Okay, Pa.

9
00:01:27,259 --> 00:01:29,056
Hi. Merry Christmas.

10
00:01:29,161 --> 00:01:31,117
I want some fruit over there.

11
00:01:34,400 --> 00:01:36,061
Gimme three of them.

12
00:01:38,003 --> 00:01:39,231
No, that one.

13
00:01:58,624 --> 00:02:00,285
Fredo!

14
00:02:47,773 --> 00:02:48,762
Papa.

15
00:02:50,309 --> 00:02:51,401
Papa!

16
00:02:57,650 --> 00:03:00,414
Would you like me better
if I were a nun...

17
00:03:00,519 --> 00:03:02,475
like in the story, you know?

18
00:03:06,358 --> 00:03:09,247
Then would you like me better
if I were Ingrid Bergman?

19
00:03:09,361 --> 00:03:10,988
Now that's a thought.

20
00:03:14,934 --> 00:03:18,165
No, I would not like you better
if you were Ingrid Bergman.

21
00:03:18,270 --> 00:03:20,101
- Mike-
- What's the matter?

22
00:03:36,555 --> 00:03:38,511
They don't say
if he's dead or alive.

23
00:04:01,447 --> 00:04:04,575
- Sonny, Michael.
- Michael, where you been?

24
00:04:04,683 --> 00:04:06,241
Is he all right?

25
00:04:06,352 --> 00:04:09,082
We don't know yet.
There's all kinds of stories.

26
00:04:10,623 --> 00:04:12,022
He was hit bad, Mikey.

27
00:04:13,559 --> 00:04:16,687
- Are you there?
- Yeah, I'm here.

28
00:04:16,795 --> 00:04:19,127
Where you been?
I was worried.

29
00:04:19,231 --> 00:04:21,290
Didn't Tom tell you?
I called.

30
00:04:21,400 --> 00:04:25,131
No. Look, come home, kid.
You should be with Mama, you hear?

31
00:04:25,237 --> 00:04:26,192
All right.

32
00:04:33,445 --> 00:04:34,742
Oh, my God.

33
00:04:49,929 --> 00:04:52,420
Go. Who is it?

34
00:04:52,531 --> 00:04:53,930
Open up. It's Clemenza.

35
00:04:56,035 --> 00:04:56,990
What?

36
00:04:57,102 --> 00:04:59,058
There's more news
about your old man.

37
00:05:00,072 --> 00:05:02,028
The word is out on the street
he's already dead.

38
00:05:02,141 --> 00:05:04,029
Shut your mouth.
What's the matter with you?

39
00:05:04,143 --> 00:05:06,566
Jesus Christ!
Take it easy.

40
00:05:06,679 --> 00:05:08,772
- Where was Paulie?
- Paulie was out sick.

41
00:05:08,881 --> 00:05:11,372
- He's been sick all winter.
- How many times he been sick?

42
00:05:11,450 --> 00:05:12,940
Only maybe three, four times.

43
00:05:13,018 --> 00:05:14,974
I asked Freddy if he wants
a different bodyguard.

44
00:05:15,087 --> 00:05:16,714
- He said no.
- Pick him up now.

45
00:05:16,822 --> 00:05:18,551
I don't care how sick he is.

46
00:05:18,657 --> 00:05:21,319
If he's breathin', I want you to
bring him to my father's house now.

47
00:05:21,427 --> 00:05:24,225
- You want me to send people here?
- No, just you and him. Go ahead.

48
00:05:24,330 --> 00:05:25,354
All right.

49
00:05:33,839 --> 00:05:36,171
I'm havin' a couple of our people
come to the house.

50
00:05:40,646 --> 00:05:42,807
- Hello?
- Santino Corleone?

51
00:05:42,915 --> 00:05:44,974
- Yeah.
- We have Tom Hagen.

52
00:05:46,085 --> 00:05:49,509
In about three hours, he'll be
released with our proposition.

53
00:05:49,622 --> 00:05:52,978
Listen to everything he has
to say before you do anything.

54
00:05:53,092 --> 00:05:54,616
What's done is done.

55
00:05:54,727 --> 00:05:57,685
And don't lose that famous temper
of yours, huh, Sonny?

56
00:05:57,796 --> 00:05:59,058
No, I'll wait.

57
00:06:13,812 --> 00:06:15,211
Your boss is dead.

58
00:06:18,651 --> 00:06:21,017
I know you're not in
the muscle end of the family...

59
00:06:21,120 --> 00:06:23,008
so I don't want you
to be scared.

60
00:06:24,189 --> 00:06:26,714
I want you
to help the Corleones...

61
00:06:26,825 --> 00:06:28,781
and I want you to help me.

62
00:06:31,897 --> 00:06:33,626
We got him outside his office...

63
00:06:33,732 --> 00:06:35,688
about an hour after
we picked you up.

64
00:06:38,070 --> 00:06:39,298
Drink it.

65
00:06:43,709 --> 00:06:47,133
So now it's up to you to make
the peace between me and Sonny.

66
00:06:51,684 --> 00:06:53,640
Sonny was hot
for my deal, wasn't he?

67
00:06:55,587 --> 00:06:57,543
And you knew it was
the right thing to do.

68
00:06:59,925 --> 00:07:01,984
Sonny will come after you
with everything he's got.

69
00:07:03,195 --> 00:07:05,220
That'll be
his first reaction, sure.

70
00:07:06,465 --> 00:07:08,763
That's why you gotta
talk some sense into him.

71
00:07:08,867 --> 00:07:12,098
The Tattaglia family is behind me
with all their people.

72
00:07:13,072 --> 00:07:15,131
The other New York families
will go along with anything...

73
00:07:15,240 --> 00:07:17,128
that will prevent
a full-scale war.

74
00:07:18,310 --> 00:07:20,574
Let's face it,
in all due respect...

75
00:07:20,679 --> 00:07:23,239
the Don, rest in peace,
was slippin'.

76
00:07:26,151 --> 00:07:28,107
Ten years ago,
could I have gotten to him?

77
00:07:33,125 --> 00:07:34,615
Well, now he's dead.

78
00:07:34,693 --> 00:07:36,718
He's dead,
and nothing can bring him back.

79
00:07:38,831 --> 00:07:40,856
So you gotta talk to Sonny.

80
00:07:40,966 --> 00:07:42,797
You gotta talk
to the caporegimes-

81
00:07:42,901 --> 00:07:44,857
that Tessio,
that fat Clemenza.

82
00:07:49,808 --> 00:07:51,105
It's good business, Tom.

83
00:07:53,245 --> 00:07:54,371
I'll try.

84
00:07:55,547 --> 00:07:58,209
But even Sonny won't be able
to call off Luca Brasi.

85
00:08:01,220 --> 00:08:02,847
Yeah. Well-

86
00:08:04,523 --> 00:08:06,411
Let me worry about Luca.

87
00:08:12,431 --> 00:08:14,228
You just talk to Sonny.

88
00:08:14,333 --> 00:08:16,289
And the other two kids.

89
00:08:20,072 --> 00:08:21,471
I'll do my best.

90
00:08:21,573 --> 00:08:22,733
Good.

91
00:08:24,877 --> 00:08:27,368
Now, you can go.

92
00:08:34,253 --> 00:08:37,586
I don't like violence, Tom.
I'm a businessman.

93
00:08:39,124 --> 00:08:41,080
Blood is a big expense.

94
00:09:02,714 --> 00:09:04,511
He's still alive.

95
00:09:04,616 --> 00:09:07,005
They hit him with five shots,
and he's still alive!

96
00:09:08,620 --> 00:09:10,508
Well, that's bad luck for me...

97
00:09:10,622 --> 00:09:13,011
and bad luck for you
if you don't make that deal.

98
00:09:58,103 --> 00:10:00,059
Your mother's over
in the hospital with your father.

99
00:10:00,172 --> 00:10:02,128
Looks like he's gonna
pull through, thank God.

100
00:10:04,743 --> 00:10:06,904
- That's a lot of bad blood.
- What do you think?

101
00:10:07,012 --> 00:10:09,867
It's too far.
I think it's too personal.

102
00:10:09,982 --> 00:10:12,644
- The Don will consider this over.
- You gonna kill all those guys?

103
00:10:12,751 --> 00:10:15,140
- Stay out of it, Mickey.
- Sollozzo's the key.

104
00:10:15,254 --> 00:10:17,449
You get rid of him,
everything falls into line.

105
00:10:17,556 --> 00:10:20,150
What about Luca? Sollozzo
didn't seem worried about Luca.

106
00:10:21,860 --> 00:10:25,626
I don't know. If Luca sold out,
we're in a lot of trouble.

107
00:10:25,731 --> 00:10:27,687
Has anyone been able
to get in touch with Luca?

108
00:10:27,799 --> 00:10:29,790
We've been tryin' all night.
He might be shacked up.

109
00:10:29,902 --> 00:10:30,857
Mick, try him again.

110
00:10:30,969 --> 00:10:32,527
Luca never sleeps over
with a broad.

111
00:10:32,638 --> 00:10:34,265
He always goes home
when he's through.

112
00:10:35,674 --> 00:10:38,632
Well, Tom, you're consigliere.

113
00:10:38,744 --> 00:10:41,872
What do we do
if the old man dies, God forbid?

114
00:10:41,980 --> 00:10:43,868
If we lose the old man...

115
00:10:45,250 --> 00:10:48,174
we lose our political contacts
and half our strength.

116
00:10:48,287 --> 00:10:51,176
The other New York families might
wind up supporting Sollozzo...

117
00:10:51,290 --> 00:10:53,554
just to avoid
a long destructive war.

118
00:10:53,659 --> 00:10:57,390
This is almost 1946.
Nobody wants bloodshed anymore.

119
00:10:58,630 --> 00:11:00,154
If your father dies...

120
00:11:02,467 --> 00:11:04,128
you'll make the deal, Sonny.

121
00:11:04,236 --> 00:11:06,796
That's easy for you to say.
He's not your father.

122
00:11:06,905 --> 00:11:09,032
I was as much a son to him
as you or Mike.

123
00:11:13,845 --> 00:11:15,073
What is it?

124
00:11:16,348 --> 00:11:18,714
Hey, Paulie, I thought
I told you to stay put.

125
00:11:18,817 --> 00:11:21,445
The guy at the gates,
they say they got a package.

126
00:11:21,553 --> 00:11:23,544
Yeah?
Tessio, go see what it is.

127
00:11:27,426 --> 00:11:29,314
- You want me to hang around?
- Yeah, hang around.

128
00:11:29,428 --> 00:11:30,827
- You all right?
- I'm fine.

129
00:11:30,929 --> 00:11:33,625
Yeah? There's some food
in the icebox. You hungry?

130
00:11:33,732 --> 00:11:35,688
- No, it's all right. Thanks.
- How 'bout a little brandy?

131
00:11:35,801 --> 00:11:37,462
- That's good to sweat it out.
- Sure.

132
00:11:37,569 --> 00:11:39,525
- Go ahead.
- That might be a good idea.

133
00:11:41,773 --> 00:11:44,196
I want you to take care
of that son of a bitch right away.

134
00:11:44,309 --> 00:11:46,834
Paulie sold out the old man.

135
00:11:46,945 --> 00:11:50,039
I don't wanna see him again.
Make that first thing on your list.

136
00:11:50,148 --> 00:11:51,376
Understood.

137
00:11:51,483 --> 00:11:53,713
Hey, Mickey, tomorrow
you get a couple of guys.

138
00:11:53,819 --> 00:11:55,912
Go to Luca's apartment.
Wait for him to show up.

139
00:11:56,021 --> 00:12:00,082
Maybe we shouldn't get Mike
mixed up in this too directly.

140
00:12:00,192 --> 00:12:01,352
Yeah.

141
00:12:02,461 --> 00:12:05,988
Listen, hang around the house
on the phone. It'll be a big help.

142
00:12:07,099 --> 00:12:08,930
Try Luca again. Go ahead.

143
00:12:17,943 --> 00:12:20,776
- What the hell is this?
- It's a Sicilian message.

144
00:12:20,879 --> 00:12:23,370
It means Luca Brasi
sleeps with the fishes.

145
00:12:37,162 --> 00:12:39,585
- I'm goin' now.
- What time you gonna be home?

146
00:12:39,698 --> 00:12:41,256
I don't know. Probably late.

147
00:12:43,468 --> 00:12:46,995
- Don't forget the cannoli.
- Yeah, yeah.

148
00:12:49,708 --> 00:12:53,496
Rocco, sit on the other side.
You block the rearview mirror.

149
00:12:55,680 --> 00:12:57,170
Sonny's runnin' wild.

150
00:12:57,249 --> 00:12:59,205
He's thinkin' of goin'
to the mattresses already.

151
00:12:59,317 --> 00:13:01,877
We gotta find a spot
over on the West Side.

152
00:13:01,987 --> 00:13:05,081
We'll try
309 West 43rd Street.

153
00:13:05,190 --> 00:13:07,454
You know any good spots
on the West Side?

154
00:13:07,559 --> 00:13:09,982
- Yeah, I'll think about it.
- Think while you're drivin'.

155
00:13:10,095 --> 00:13:12,325
I wanna hit New York
sometime this month.

156
00:13:12,431 --> 00:13:14,387
And watch out for the kids
when you're backin' out.

157
00:13:25,310 --> 00:13:27,642
Paulie, I want you to go
down 39th Street. Colosanto's.

158
00:13:27,746 --> 00:13:30,806
Pick up 18 mattresses for the guys
to sleep. Bring me the bill.

159
00:13:30,916 --> 00:13:33,805
- Yeah, all right.
- Make sure they're clean.

160
00:13:33,919 --> 00:13:37,116
Those guys are gonna be stuck up
in there for a long time.

161
00:13:37,222 --> 00:13:39,315
They're clean. They told me
they exterminate them.

162
00:13:39,424 --> 00:13:41,415
"Exterminate"?
That's a bad word to use.

163
00:13:41,526 --> 00:13:44,484
Exterminate. Get this guy.
See how we don't exterminate you.

164
00:13:44,596 --> 00:13:46,552
- Youse funny, or what?
- Hey, Paulie?

165
00:13:48,300 --> 00:13:50,791
- Yeah, Rocco, what'd you do?
- No, me. It wasn't me.

166
00:13:50,869 --> 00:13:52,825
- It's gotta be him.
- Pull over.

167
00:13:52,938 --> 00:13:54,826
I gotta take a leak.

168
00:14:36,648 --> 00:14:38,343
Leave the gun.

169
00:14:38,450 --> 00:14:39,849
Take the cannoli.

170
00:15:02,741 --> 00:15:04,663
- Yeah?
- You're wanted on the telephone.

171
00:15:10,949 --> 00:15:12,940
- Who is it?
- It's some girl.

172
00:15:17,522 --> 00:15:18,614
Hello, Kay?

173
00:15:18,723 --> 00:15:19,985
How's your father?

174
00:15:20,091 --> 00:15:21,786
He's good.
He's gonna make it.

175
00:15:21,893 --> 00:15:23,383
I love you.

176
00:15:25,697 --> 00:15:27,130
I love you!

177
00:15:28,333 --> 00:15:30,631
- Michael?
- Yeah, I know.

178
00:15:30,735 --> 00:15:32,532
Tell me you love me.

179
00:15:32,637 --> 00:15:35,003
- I can't talk.
- Can’t you say it?

180
00:15:36,942 --> 00:15:38,705
Yeah, I'll see you tonight.

181
00:15:39,644 --> 00:15:42,636
Why don't you tell
that nice girl you love her?

182
00:15:42,747 --> 00:15:44,703
I love you
with all o' my heart!

183
00:15:44,816 --> 00:15:47,341
If I don't see you again a-soon,
I'm-a gonna die!

184
00:15:48,587 --> 00:15:50,475
Come over here, kid.
Learn somethin'.

185
00:15:50,589 --> 00:15:52,716
You might have to cook
for 20 guys someday.

186
00:15:53,592 --> 00:15:55,822
You see? You start out
with a little bit of oil.

187
00:15:55,927 --> 00:15:57,417
Then you fry some garlic.

188
00:15:57,495 --> 00:16:00,123
Then you throw in some tomatoes,
some tomato paste.

189
00:16:00,232 --> 00:16:02,894
You fry it.
You make sure it doesn't stick.

190
00:16:03,001 --> 00:16:06,164
When you got it to a boil, shove in
all your sausage and meatballs.

191
00:16:09,040 --> 00:16:10,598
And a little bit of wine.

192
00:16:14,379 --> 00:16:17,268
And a little bit of sugar.

193
00:16:18,049 --> 00:16:19,937
- And that's my trick.
- Why don't you cut the crap?

194
00:16:20,051 --> 00:16:22,110
I got more important things
for you to do.

195
00:16:22,220 --> 00:16:24,814
- How's Paulie?
- Won't see him no more.

196
00:16:26,891 --> 00:16:29,280
- Where you going?
- To the city.

197
00:16:29,394 --> 00:16:30,952
Send some bodyguards with him.

198
00:16:31,062 --> 00:16:32,950
- I'm just going to see Pop.
- Send somebody with him.

199
00:16:33,064 --> 00:16:35,953
He'll be all right.
Sollozzo knows he's a civilian.

200
00:16:36,067 --> 00:16:38,456
- All right. Be careful, huh?
- Yes, sir.

201
00:16:41,573 --> 00:16:43,871
Send somebody with him anyway.

202
00:17:12,270 --> 00:17:13,999
I have to go.

203
00:17:14,105 --> 00:17:15,504
Can I go with you?

204
00:17:16,941 --> 00:17:19,501
No, Kay. There's gonna be
detectives there.

205
00:17:19,611 --> 00:17:21,499
People from the press.

206
00:17:21,613 --> 00:17:23,342
I'll ride in a cab.

207
00:17:26,117 --> 00:17:28,347
I don't want you
to get involved.

208
00:17:31,289 --> 00:17:33,018
When will I see you again?

209
00:17:39,964 --> 00:17:41,852
Go back to New Hampshire...

210
00:17:41,966 --> 00:17:44,093
and I'll call you
at your parents' house.

211
00:17:45,804 --> 00:17:47,863
When will I see you again,
Michael?

212
00:17:49,808 --> 00:17:51,207
I don't know.

213
00:20:02,340 --> 00:20:04,365
What are you doing here?

214
00:20:04,476 --> 00:20:06,467
You're not supposed
to be here now.

215
00:20:06,578 --> 00:20:10,139
I'm Michael Corleone.
This is my father.

216
00:20:10,248 --> 00:20:12,808
There's nobody here.
What happened to the guards?

217
00:20:12,917 --> 00:20:15,147
Your father just had
too many visitors.

218
00:20:15,253 --> 00:20:18,142
They interfered
with hospital service.

219
00:20:18,256 --> 00:20:21,145
The police made them leave
about ten minutes ago.

220
00:20:26,097 --> 00:20:29,988
Get me Long Beach 4-5-6-2-0,
please.

221
00:20:32,604 --> 00:20:34,993
Nurse, wait a minute.
Stay here.

222
00:20:38,943 --> 00:20:41,173
Sonny, Michael.
I'm at the hospital.

223
00:20:41,279 --> 00:20:43,839
Listen. I got here late.
There's nobody here.

224
00:20:43,948 --> 00:20:46,940
Nobody. No Tessio's men,
no detectives, nobody.

225
00:20:47,051 --> 00:20:49,849
- Pop is all alone.
- Don't panic. We'll send somebody.

226
00:20:49,954 --> 00:20:52,184
I won't panic.

227
00:20:52,290 --> 00:20:54,850
I'm sorry, but you will
have to leave.

228
00:20:57,795 --> 00:21:00,525
You and I are gonna move my father
to another room.

229
00:21:00,632 --> 00:21:03,692
Can you disconnect those tubes
so we can move the bed out?

230
00:21:03,801 --> 00:21:07,293
- That's out of the question.
- Do you know my father?

231
00:21:07,405 --> 00:21:09,498
Men are coming here
to kill him.

232
00:21:09,607 --> 00:21:11,632
You understand?

233
00:21:11,743 --> 00:21:13,802
Now, help me, please.

234
00:22:30,588 --> 00:22:35,321
- Who are you?
- I am Enzo- the baker.

235
00:22:35,426 --> 00:22:36,825
- You remember me?
- Enzo?

236
00:22:36,928 --> 00:22:38,657
- Yes, Enzo.
- You better get out of here, Enzo.

237
00:22:38,763 --> 00:22:40,651
There's gonna be trouble.

238
00:22:40,765 --> 00:22:43,154
If there is trouble,
I stay here to help you-

239
00:22:43,267 --> 00:22:45,326
For your father.

240
00:22:46,771 --> 00:22:48,500
All right, listen.

241
00:22:48,606 --> 00:22:50,665
Wait for me outside,
in front of the hospital.

242
00:22:50,775 --> 00:22:53,801
All right? I'll be out
in a minute. Go ahead.

243
00:23:07,725 --> 00:23:12,014
Just lie here, Pop.
I'll take care of you now.

244
00:23:13,231 --> 00:23:14,789
I'm with you now.

245
00:23:16,901 --> 00:23:18,493
I'm with you.

246
00:23:53,938 --> 00:23:56,133
Get rid of these.
Come here.

247
00:23:56,774 --> 00:23:58,765
Put your hand in your pocket
like you have a gun.

248
00:23:59,944 --> 00:24:01,343
You'll be all right.

249
00:24:06,718 --> 00:24:08,151
You'll be okay.

250
00:24:52,930 --> 00:24:54,921
You did good.

251
00:25:28,566 --> 00:25:30,625
Here he is.

252
00:25:30,735 --> 00:25:32,225
All right, hold still.

253
00:25:42,747 --> 00:25:45,011
I thought I got
all you guinea hoods locked up.

254
00:25:45,116 --> 00:25:46,481
What are you doing here?

255
00:25:46,584 --> 00:25:48,814
What happened to the men who
were guarding my father, Captain?

256
00:25:49,420 --> 00:25:50,978
Why, you little punk.

257
00:25:51,088 --> 00:25:52,976
What the hell are you doing,
telling me my business?

258
00:25:53,090 --> 00:25:54,887
I pulled them guys off
of here.

259
00:25:54,992 --> 00:25:57,984
You get out of here
and stay away from this hospital.

260
00:25:58,095 --> 00:26:01,053
I'm not moving until you put
some guards around my father's room.

261
00:26:01,766 --> 00:26:03,654
Phil, take him in.

262
00:26:03,768 --> 00:26:06,100
The kid's clean, Captain.
He's a war hero.

263
00:26:06,204 --> 00:26:09,093
- He's never been busted-
- Goddamn it, I said take him in.

264
00:26:11,209 --> 00:26:13,734
What's the Turk paying you
to set up my father, Captain?

265
00:26:15,046 --> 00:26:17,071
Take ahold of him.
Stand him up.

266
00:26:17,181 --> 00:26:19,206
Stand him up straight.

267
00:26:41,572 --> 00:26:43,528
I'm the attorney
for the Corleone family.

268
00:26:43,641 --> 00:26:46,371
These men are private detectives
hired to protect Vito Corleone.

269
00:26:47,245 --> 00:26:48,906
They're licensed to carry
firearms.

270
00:26:49,013 --> 00:26:51,504
If you interfere, you'll have to
appear before a judge...

271
00:26:51,582 --> 00:26:54,142
in the morning
and show cause.

272
00:26:54,252 --> 00:26:56,743
All right, let him go.

273
00:26:56,821 --> 00:26:58,220
Come on.

274
00:27:28,786 --> 00:27:30,674
What's with all the new faces?

275
00:27:30,788 --> 00:27:32,517
Gonna need 'em now.

276
00:27:32,623 --> 00:27:35,251
After the hospital thing,
Sonny got mad.

277
00:27:35,359 --> 00:27:38,487
We hit Bruno Tattaglia
at 4:00 this morning.

278
00:27:39,797 --> 00:27:41,196
Jesus Christ.

279
00:27:48,639 --> 00:27:50,698
Looks like a fortress
around here.

280
00:27:55,646 --> 00:27:58,535
A hundred button men on the street,
24 hours a day.

281
00:27:58,649 --> 00:28:01,880
That Turk shows one hair
on his ass, he's dead. Believe me.

282
00:28:04,488 --> 00:28:06,376
Hey, Michael, come here.
Let me look at you.

283
00:28:10,428 --> 00:28:12,020
You look beautiful.
Just beautiful.

284
00:28:12,129 --> 00:28:13,528
You're gorgeous.

285
00:28:13,631 --> 00:28:16,327
Hey, listen to this.
The Turk, he wants to talk.

286
00:28:16,434 --> 00:28:19,164
Imagine the nerve
on this son of a bitch.

287
00:28:19,270 --> 00:28:21,500
Craps out last night,
he wants a meeting today.

288
00:28:21,605 --> 00:28:23,334
- What'd he say?
- What did he say?

289
00:28:24,775 --> 00:28:26,834
He wants us to send Michael
to hear the proposition.

290
00:28:26,944 --> 00:28:30,004
And the promise is that the deal
is so good that we can't refuse.

291
00:28:30,614 --> 00:28:32,172
What about Bruno Tattaglia?

292
00:28:32,283 --> 00:28:33,841
That's part of the deal.

293
00:28:33,951 --> 00:28:35,839
Bruno cancels out what they did
to my father.

294
00:28:35,953 --> 00:28:37,841
Sonny, we ought to hear
what they have to say.

295
00:28:39,290 --> 00:28:41,178
No more.
Not this time, Consigliere.

296
00:28:41,292 --> 00:28:44,853
No more meetings, no discussions,
no more Sollozzo tricks.

297
00:28:44,962 --> 00:28:46,691
You give them one message-
I want Sollozzo.

298
00:28:46,797 --> 00:28:48,355
If not, it's all-out war.
We go to the mattresses.

299
00:28:48,466 --> 00:28:50,024
Some of the other families
won't sit still for a war.

300
00:28:50,134 --> 00:28:52,193
- Then they hand me Sollozzo.
- Your father wouldn't like this.

301
00:28:52,303 --> 00:28:55,363
- This is business, not personal.
- They shot my father.

302
00:28:55,473 --> 00:28:58,863
Even shooting your father
was business, not personal, Sonny.

303
00:28:58,976 --> 00:29:00,705
Well, then business
will have to suffer.

304
00:29:00,811 --> 00:29:02,540
And do me a favor, Tom-

305
00:29:02,646 --> 00:29:04,534
No more advice on how
to patch things up.

306
00:29:04,648 --> 00:29:06,479
Just help me win, please.
All right?

307
00:29:13,090 --> 00:29:15,650
I found out about this McCluskey
who broke Mike's jaw.

308
00:29:15,760 --> 00:29:17,159
What about him?

309
00:29:17,261 --> 00:29:20,321
He's definitely on Sollozzo's
payroll, and for big money.

310
00:29:20,431 --> 00:29:23,320
McCluskey has agreed
to be the Turk's bodyguard.

311
00:29:23,434 --> 00:29:25,322
What you have to understand,
Sonny...

312
00:29:25,436 --> 00:29:27,495
is that while Sollozzo's
being guarded like this...

313
00:29:27,605 --> 00:29:29,334
he is invulnerable.

314
00:29:29,440 --> 00:29:33,001
Nobody has ever gunned down
a New York police captain. Never.

315
00:29:33,110 --> 00:29:36,170
It would be disastrous. All the
five families would come after you.

316
00:29:36,280 --> 00:29:39,010
The Corleone family
would be outcast.

317
00:29:39,116 --> 00:29:42,813
Even the old man's political
protection would run for cover.

318
00:29:44,288 --> 00:29:46,347
So do me a favor.

319
00:29:46,457 --> 00:29:49,085
Take this into consideration.

320
00:29:51,896 --> 00:29:53,386
All right, we'll wait.

321
00:29:59,136 --> 00:30:00,535
We can't wait.

322
00:30:01,639 --> 00:30:03,527
Can't wait.

323
00:30:03,641 --> 00:30:05,302
I don't care what Sollozzo says
about a deal.

324
00:30:05,409 --> 00:30:07,468
He's gonna kill Pop.
That's it.

325
00:30:07,578 --> 00:30:09,307
That's the key for him.

326
00:30:09,413 --> 00:30:11,301
Got to get Sollozzo.

327
00:30:11,415 --> 00:30:13,474
Mike is right.

328
00:30:13,584 --> 00:30:15,472
Let me ask you something first.

329
00:30:15,586 --> 00:30:18,646
What about this McCluskey?

330
00:30:18,756 --> 00:30:20,644
What do we do
with this cop?

331
00:30:25,596 --> 00:30:27,655
They want to have a meeting
with me, right?

332
00:30:29,600 --> 00:30:32,160
It will be me...

333
00:30:32,269 --> 00:30:34,157
McCluskey and Sollozzo.

334
00:30:35,773 --> 00:30:37,172
Let's set the meeting.

335
00:30:39,944 --> 00:30:43,334
Get our informers to find out
where it's going to be held.

336
00:30:45,449 --> 00:30:49,180
We insist it's a public place-
a bar, a restaurant.

337
00:30:49,286 --> 00:30:53,017
Someplace where there's people,
so I feel safe.

338
00:30:55,960 --> 00:30:58,849
They're gonna search me
when I first meet them, right?

339
00:30:58,963 --> 00:31:00,851
So I can't have a weapon
on me then.

340
00:31:04,635 --> 00:31:07,126
But if Clemenza can figure a way...

341
00:31:07,238 --> 00:31:09,627
to have a weapon
planted there for me...

342
00:31:14,578 --> 00:31:16,136
then I'll kill them both.

343
00:31:28,959 --> 00:31:31,484
What are you gonna do?
Nice college boy, huh?

344
00:31:31,595 --> 00:31:33,483
Didn't want to get mixed up
in the family business.

345
00:31:33,597 --> 00:31:35,485
Now you want to gun down
a police captain?

346
00:31:35,599 --> 00:31:37,487
Why? 'Cause he slapped you
in the face a little bit?

347
00:31:37,601 --> 00:31:39,831
Do you think this is the army,
where you shoot them a mile away?

348
00:31:39,937 --> 00:31:41,495
You gotta get up close,
like this and-

349
00:31:41,605 --> 00:31:44,995
You blow their brains all over your
nice Ivy League suit. Come here.

350
00:31:45,109 --> 00:31:47,339
You're taking this
very personal.

351
00:31:47,444 --> 00:31:50,675
Tom, this is business, and this man
is taking it very, very personal.

352
00:31:50,781 --> 00:31:52,703
Where does it say
you can't kill a cop?

353
00:31:52,816 --> 00:31:55,341
- Come on, Mikey.
- Tom, wait a minute.

354
00:31:55,452 --> 00:31:58,182
I'm talking about a cop
that's mixed up in drugs.

355
00:31:58,289 --> 00:32:02,419
I'm talking about a dishonest cop,
a crooked cop...

356
00:32:02,526 --> 00:32:05,381
who got mixed up in the rackets
and got what was coming to him.

357
00:32:05,496 --> 00:32:07,452
That's a terrific story.

358
00:32:07,565 --> 00:32:10,295
We have newspaper people
on the payroll, don't we, Tom?

359
00:32:11,835 --> 00:32:13,962
They might like
a story like that.

360
00:32:14,071 --> 00:32:15,868
They might.
They just might.

361
00:32:19,410 --> 00:32:21,469
It's not personal, Sonny.

362
00:32:21,579 --> 00:32:22,978
It's strictly business.

363
00:32:26,083 --> 00:32:27,641
It's as cold as they come.

364
00:32:27,751 --> 00:32:31,312
Impossible to trace, so you don't
worry about prints, Mike.

365
00:32:31,422 --> 00:32:34,311
I put a special tape
on the trigger and the butt.

366
00:32:34,425 --> 00:32:35,824
Here. Try it.

367
00:32:47,605 --> 00:32:49,493
What's the matter,
the trigger too tight?

368
00:32:53,277 --> 00:32:55,336
- My ears.
- I left it noisy.

369
00:32:55,446 --> 00:33:00,179
That way it scares pain-in-the-ass
innocent bystanders away.

370
00:33:00,284 --> 00:33:02,514
All right, you shot them both.
Now what do you do?

371
00:33:05,389 --> 00:33:07,448
Sit down, finish my dinner.

372
00:33:07,558 --> 00:33:09,116
Come on, kid.
Don't fool around.

373
00:33:09,226 --> 00:33:12,787
Just let your hand drop to your side
and let the gun slip out.

374
00:33:12,896 --> 00:33:14,955
Everybody will still think
you got it.

375
00:33:15,065 --> 00:33:17,124
They're gonna be staring
at your face, Mike...

376
00:33:17,234 --> 00:33:20,294
so walk out of the place real fast,
but you don't run.

377
00:33:20,404 --> 00:33:23,794
Don't look nobody directly in the
eye, but don't look away, either.

378
00:33:23,907 --> 00:33:25,795
They're gonna be scared stiff
of you, believe me...

379
00:33:25,909 --> 00:33:27,274
so don't worry about nothing.

380
00:33:29,580 --> 00:33:31,309
You know, you're gonna turn out
all right.

381
00:33:31,415 --> 00:33:33,645
You take a long vacation,
nobody knows where...

382
00:33:33,751 --> 00:33:36,140
and we're gonna catch
the hell.

383
00:33:36,253 --> 00:33:38,312
How bad do you think
it's gonna be?

384
00:33:38,422 --> 00:33:40,310
Pretty goddamn bad.

385
00:33:40,424 --> 00:33:43,484
Probably all the other families
will line up against us.

386
00:33:43,594 --> 00:33:46,483
That's all right. These things
gotta happen every five years or so.

387
00:33:46,597 --> 00:33:49,157
Ten years.
Helps to get rid of the bad blood.

388
00:33:49,266 --> 00:33:51,826
Been ten years since
the last one.

389
00:33:51,935 --> 00:33:53,823
You gotta stop them
at the beginning...

390
00:33:53,937 --> 00:33:55,996
like they should have
stopped Hitler at Munich.

391
00:33:56,106 --> 00:33:57,994
They should have never let him
get away with that.

392
00:33:58,108 --> 00:33:59,905
They was just asking
for big trouble.

393
00:34:00,944 --> 00:34:03,504
You know, Mike,
we was all proud of you...

394
00:34:03,614 --> 00:34:05,275
being a hero and all.

395
00:34:05,382 --> 00:34:06,781
Your father too.

396
00:34:45,255 --> 00:34:46,984
Nothing.
Not a hint.

397
00:34:47,091 --> 00:34:48,490
Absolutely nothing.

398
00:34:49,760 --> 00:34:52,649
Even Sollozzo's people don't know
where the meeting will be held.

399
00:34:53,931 --> 00:34:55,489
How much time do we have?

400
00:34:57,267 --> 00:34:58,996
Gonna pick you up in front
of Jack Dempsey's joint...

401
00:34:59,103 --> 00:35:01,492
in an hour and a half-
exactly an hour and a half.

402
00:35:03,273 --> 00:35:05,764
We could put a tail on them,
see how it turns out.

403
00:35:05,876 --> 00:35:09,107
Sollozzo'll lose our ass
going around the block.

404
00:35:09,213 --> 00:35:10,646
What about the negotiator?

405
00:35:10,748 --> 00:35:13,444
He's over at my place playing
pinochle with a couple of my men.

406
00:35:13,550 --> 00:35:15,245
He's happy.
They're letting him win.

407
00:35:15,352 --> 00:35:18,981
It's too much of a risk for Mike.
Maybe we ought to call it off.

408
00:35:19,089 --> 00:35:22,650
The negotiator keeps playing cards
until Mike's back safe and sound.

409
00:35:22,760 --> 00:35:24,955
Why doesn't he blast who's ever
in the goddamn car?

410
00:35:25,062 --> 00:35:26,950
Too dangerous.
They'll be looking for that.

411
00:35:27,064 --> 00:35:29,123
Sollozzo might not
even be in the car, Sonny.

412
00:35:30,234 --> 00:35:31,633
I got it.

413
00:35:42,079 --> 00:35:43,478
Yeah.

414
00:35:56,927 --> 00:36:00,317
- Louis Restaurant in the Bronx.
- Is it reliable?

415
00:36:00,431 --> 00:36:02,160
That's my man
in McCluskey's precinct.

416
00:36:02,266 --> 00:36:05,099
A police captain's got to be
on call 24 hours a day.

417
00:36:05,202 --> 00:36:08,091
He signed out at that number
between 8:00 and 10:00.

418
00:36:08,205 --> 00:36:09,695
Anybody know this joint?

419
00:36:09,773 --> 00:36:13,163
Yeah, sure. I do.
It's perfect for us.

420
00:36:13,277 --> 00:36:15,438
A small family place,
good food.

421
00:36:15,546 --> 00:36:18,379
Everyone minds his business.
It's perfect.

422
00:36:18,482 --> 00:36:21,280
Pete, they got
an old-fashioned toilet-

423
00:36:21,385 --> 00:36:24,616
You know, the box
and the chain thing.

424
00:36:26,223 --> 00:36:28,783
We might be able
to tape the gun behind it.

425
00:36:28,892 --> 00:36:30,291
All right.

426
00:36:30,394 --> 00:36:33,557
Mike, you go to the restaurant.

427
00:36:33,664 --> 00:36:35,962
You eat, you talk for a while,
you relax.

428
00:36:36,066 --> 00:36:37,658
You make them relax.

429
00:36:37,768 --> 00:36:40,032
Then you get up
and go take a leak.

430
00:36:40,137 --> 00:36:42,799
No, better still,
you ask for permission to go.

431
00:36:42,906 --> 00:36:44,669
And when you come back,
you come out blasting.

432
00:36:44,775 --> 00:36:47,699
And don't take any chances.
Two shots in the head apiece.

433
00:36:47,811 --> 00:36:49,802
Now, listen.
I want somebody good-

434
00:36:49,913 --> 00:36:51,801
and I mean very good-
to plant that gun.

435
00:36:51,915 --> 00:36:54,907
I don't want him coming out
with just his dick in his hands.

436
00:36:55,018 --> 00:36:56,645
The gun will be there.

437
00:36:56,753 --> 00:37:00,985
All right, listen. You drive him
and you pick him up after the job.

438
00:37:01,091 --> 00:37:03,582
Come on. Let's move.

439
00:37:03,660 --> 00:37:05,059
Thank you, Tom.

440
00:37:08,432 --> 00:37:11,321
Did he tell you
to drop the gun right away?

441
00:37:11,435 --> 00:37:13,164
Yeah, a million times.

442
00:37:18,108 --> 00:37:20,497
Don't forget-
two shots apiece in the head...

443
00:37:20,611 --> 00:37:22,670
as soon as you
come out the door.

444
00:37:22,779 --> 00:37:24,178
Let's go.

445
00:37:28,785 --> 00:37:31,515
How long do you think it'll be
before I can come back?

446
00:37:33,457 --> 00:37:35,516
At least a year, Mike.

447
00:37:35,626 --> 00:37:39,187
Listen, I'll square with Mom you
not seeing her before you leave...

448
00:37:39,296 --> 00:37:43,687
and I'll get a message
to that girlfriend...

449
00:37:43,800 --> 00:37:45,427
when I think the time is right.

450
00:37:51,475 --> 00:37:52,965
Take care.

451
00:37:56,146 --> 00:37:58,034
- See you, Mike.
- Okay, Tom.

452
00:38:30,447 --> 00:38:32,335
I'm glad you came, Mike.

453
00:38:32,449 --> 00:38:34,314
I hope we can
straighten everything out.

454
00:38:35,619 --> 00:38:38,474
This is terrible. It's not the way
I wanted things to go at all.

455
00:38:38,589 --> 00:38:40,352
It should have
never happened.

456
00:38:40,457 --> 00:38:42,516
I want to straighten
everything out tonight.

457
00:38:42,626 --> 00:38:45,015
I don't want my father
bothered anymore.

458
00:38:45,128 --> 00:38:49,189
He won't be, Mike.
I swear on my children he won't be.

459
00:38:49,299 --> 00:38:52,530
But you got to keep an open mind
when we talk.

460
00:38:52,636 --> 00:38:55,025
I hope you're not a hothead
like your brother Sonny.

461
00:38:55,138 --> 00:38:57,026
You can't talk business
with him.

462
00:38:58,809 --> 00:39:00,208
He's a good kid.

463
00:39:04,648 --> 00:39:06,809
I'm sorry about
the other night, Mike.

464
00:39:08,251 --> 00:39:10,640
I gotta frisk you,
so turn around, huh?

465
00:39:10,754 --> 00:39:12,483
On your knees,
facing me.

466
00:39:17,094 --> 00:39:19,983
I guess I'm getting
too old for my job.

467
00:39:21,098 --> 00:39:23,054
Too grouchy.

468
00:39:23,166 --> 00:39:25,828
Can't stand the aggravation.

469
00:39:25,936 --> 00:39:27,301
You know how it is.

470
00:39:29,272 --> 00:39:30,705
He's clean.

471
00:39:57,634 --> 00:39:59,659
We're going to Jersey?

472
00:40:01,805 --> 00:40:03,102
Maybe.

473
00:40:28,932 --> 00:40:30,422
Nice work, Lou.

474
00:41:08,105 --> 00:41:10,061
How's the Italian food
in this restaurant?

475
00:41:10,173 --> 00:41:12,505
Good.
Try the veal.

476
00:41:12,609 --> 00:41:14,600
- It's the best in the city.
- I'll have it.

477
00:41:51,114 --> 00:41:52,877
I'm gonna speak Italian
to Mike.

478
00:41:52,983 --> 00:41:54,382
Go ahead.

479
00:43:13,897 --> 00:43:15,296
What I want-

480
00:43:16,566 --> 00:43:18,454
what's most important to me-

481
00:43:21,404 --> 00:43:23,463
is that I have a guarantee:

482
00:43:23,573 --> 00:43:25,632
no more attempts
on my father's life.

483
00:43:25,742 --> 00:43:29,974
What guarantees could I give you?
I am the hunted one.

484
00:43:30,580 --> 00:43:33,640
I missed my chance.
You think too much of me, kid.

485
00:43:33,750 --> 00:43:35,638
I'm not that clever.

486
00:43:37,420 --> 00:43:39,809
All I want is a truce.

487
00:43:46,429 --> 00:43:50,126
I have to go to the bathroom.
Is that all right?

488
00:43:51,434 --> 00:43:53,129
You gotta go, you gotta go.

489
00:43:59,576 --> 00:44:01,100
I frisked him.
He's clean.

490
00:44:01,211 --> 00:44:03,167
Don't take too long.

491
00:44:06,883 --> 00:44:08,680
I've frisked a thousand
young punks.
