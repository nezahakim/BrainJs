1
00:00:52,760 --> 00:00:54,716
Give me a drop.

2
00:01:02,520 --> 00:01:05,478
My wife is crying upstairs.

3
00:01:06,960 --> 00:01:10,077
I hear cars coming to the house.

4
00:01:13,720 --> 00:01:16,678
<i>Consigliere</i> of mine,

5
00:01:16,880 --> 00:01:20,111
tell your Don what everyone
seems to know.

6
00:01:20,320 --> 00:01:22,788
I didn't tell Mama anything.

7
00:01:23,520 --> 00:01:27,149
I was about to come up and wake you
and tell you.

8
00:01:29,840 --> 00:01:31,990
But you needed a drink first.

9
00:01:34,480 --> 00:01:36,152
Yeah.

10
00:01:38,560 --> 00:01:41,358
Well, now you've had your drink.

11
00:01:46,240 --> 00:01:50,552
They shot Sonny on the causeway.
He's dead.

12
00:02:06,840 --> 00:02:09,479
I want no inquiries made.

13
00:02:13,200 --> 00:02:15,839
I want no acts of vengeance.

14
00:02:17,160 --> 00:02:19,594
I want you to arrange a meeting...

15
00:02:20,800 --> 00:02:23,758
...with the heads of the five families.

16
00:02:25,240 --> 00:02:27,674
This war stops now.

17
00:02:48,240 --> 00:02:50,435
Call Bonasera.

18
00:02:50,680 --> 00:02:53,069
I need him now.

19
00:03:04,520 --> 00:03:09,435
This is Tom Hagen. I'm calling for
Vito Corleone, at his request.

20
00:03:09,640 --> 00:03:11,949
You owe your Don a service.

21
00:03:12,160 --> 00:03:15,436
<i>He has no doubt that you will repay it.</i>

22
00:03:15,640 --> 00:03:20,350
<i>He will be at your funeral parlour</i>
<i>in one hour. Be there to greet him.</i>

23
00:03:40,080 --> 00:03:44,710
Well, my friend, are you ready
to do me this service?

24
00:03:44,920 --> 00:03:48,879
Yes. What do you want me to do?

25
00:03:55,720 --> 00:04:00,635
I want you to use all your powers
and all your skills.

26
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:07,151
I don't want his mother
to see him this way.

27
00:04:22,280 --> 00:04:25,352
Look how they massacred my boy.

28
00:04:54,280 --> 00:04:56,236
It's safer to teach you English!

29
00:04:56,440 --> 00:04:57,953
I know English...

30
00:04:58,160 --> 00:05:03,109
Monday, Tuesday, Thursday,
Wednesday, Friday, Sunday, Saturday.

31
00:05:10,320 --> 00:05:12,629
Greetings, Don Tommasino.

32
00:05:12,840 --> 00:05:15,400
How are things in Palermo?

33
00:05:20,360 --> 00:05:25,753
Michael is teaching me to
drive... watch, I'll show you.

34
00:05:26,520 --> 00:05:28,954
How are things in Palermo?

35
00:05:29,160 --> 00:05:31,913
Young people don't respect
anything any more...

36
00:05:32,120 --> 00:05:35,476
times are changing for the worse.

37
00:05:38,120 --> 00:05:43,638
This place has become
too dangerous for you.

38
00:05:43,840 --> 00:05:50,871
I want you to move to a villa
near Siracusa... right now.

39
00:05:53,960 --> 00:05:56,394
What's wrong?

40
00:05:56,640 --> 00:05:59,598
Bad news from America.

41
00:06:00,360 --> 00:06:05,559
Your brother, Santino,
they killed him.

42
00:06:11,360 --> 00:06:13,351
Let's go... you promised.

43
00:06:31,400 --> 00:06:33,914
Get the car.

44
00:06:34,520 --> 00:06:38,513
Are you driving yourself, Boss?
Is your wife coming with you?

45
00:06:38,720 --> 00:06:42,110
No, take her to her father's house
until things are safe.

46
00:06:42,320 --> 00:06:44,629
Okay, anything you say.

47
00:06:50,080 --> 00:06:52,355
Calo, where is Apollonia?

48
00:06:52,560 --> 00:06:56,519
She's going to surprise you.
She wants to drive.

49
00:06:58,080 --> 00:07:01,038
She'll make a good American wife.

50
00:07:01,680 --> 00:07:03,955
Wait, I'll get the baggage.

51
00:07:13,280 --> 00:07:15,635
Fabrizio!

52
00:07:15,840 --> 00:07:18,274
Where are you going?

53
00:07:19,040 --> 00:07:22,635
Wait there! I'll drive to you.

54
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:28,319
No, Apollonia!

55
00:07:50,640 --> 00:07:56,078
Don Barzini, I want to thank you
for helping me organise this meeting,

56
00:07:56,280 --> 00:08:01,354
and the other heads of the five families
from New York and New Jersey.

57
00:08:02,520 --> 00:08:05,478
Carmine Cuneo from the Bronx,

58
00:08:05,680 --> 00:08:09,070
and from Brooklyn...

59
00:08:10,400 --> 00:08:12,630
...Philip Tattaglia.

60
00:08:13,920 --> 00:08:16,753
And from Staten Island

61
00:08:16,960 --> 00:08:20,191
we have with us Victor Strachi.

62
00:08:20,400 --> 00:08:25,872
And the other associates that came as
far as from California and Kansas City

63
00:08:26,080 --> 00:08:29,993
and all the other territories
of the country. Thank you.

64
00:08:35,880 --> 00:08:39,077
How did things ever get so far?

65
00:08:39,280 --> 00:08:41,236
I don't know.

66
00:08:42,840 --> 00:08:46,958
It was so unfortunate, so unnecessary.

67
00:08:49,200 --> 00:08:52,875
Tattaglia lost a son, and I lost a son.

68
00:08:54,800 --> 00:08:58,156
We're quits. And if Tattaglia agrees,

69
00:08:58,360 --> 00:09:02,148
then I'm willing to let things go on
as before.

70
00:09:03,400 --> 00:09:06,836
We're grateful to Don Corleone
for calling this meeting.

71
00:09:07,040 --> 00:09:11,955
We all know him as a man of his word.
A modest man who listens to reason.

72
00:09:12,160 --> 00:09:15,914
Yes, Don Barzini. He's too modest.

73
00:09:16,120 --> 00:09:19,317
He had all the judges and politicians
in his pocket.

74
00:09:20,240 --> 00:09:23,198
He refused to share them.

75
00:09:23,400 --> 00:09:26,756
When did I ever refuse
an accommodation?

76
00:09:26,960 --> 00:09:29,394
All of you know me.

77
00:09:30,080 --> 00:09:35,200
When did I ever refuse,
except one time? And why?

78
00:09:36,640 --> 00:09:42,192
Because I believe this drug business
will destroy us in the years to come.

79
00:09:42,400 --> 00:09:46,109
It's not like gambling or liquor
or even women,

80
00:09:46,320 --> 00:09:52,111
which is something that most people
want, but is forbidden by the Church.

81
00:09:52,320 --> 00:09:56,791
Even the police that have helped us in
the past with gambling and other things

82
00:09:57,000 --> 00:10:00,879
are going to refuse to help us
when it comes to narcotics.

83
00:10:01,080 --> 00:10:05,870
I believed that then...
and I believe that now.

84
00:10:06,080 --> 00:10:08,071
Times have changed.

85
00:10:08,280 --> 00:10:12,751
It's not like the old days,
when we could do anything we wanted.

86
00:10:12,960 --> 00:10:15,599
A refusal is not the act of a friend.

87
00:10:15,800 --> 00:10:20,954
If Don Corleone had all the judges and
politicians, then he must share them

88
00:10:21,160 --> 00:10:25,790
or let others use them. He must let us
draw the water from the well.

89
00:10:26,400 --> 00:10:29,836
Certainly he can present a bill
for such services.

90
00:10:30,040 --> 00:10:32,838
After all, we're not communists.

91
00:10:35,320 --> 00:10:38,278
I also don't believe in drugs.

92
00:10:38,480 --> 00:10:43,076
For years I paid my people extra, so
they wouldn't do that kind of business.

93
00:10:43,280 --> 00:10:46,238
Somebody says to them
"I have powders."

94
00:10:46,440 --> 00:10:53,278
"If you put up 3-4,000 dollar investment,
we can make 50,000 distributing."

95
00:10:53,480 --> 00:10:59,032
They can't resist. I want to control it
as a business, keep it respectable.

96
00:10:59,240 --> 00:11:03,950
I don't want it near schools,
I don't want it sold to children.

97
00:11:04,160 --> 00:11:06,833
That's an <i>infàmia.</i>

98
00:11:07,040 --> 00:11:10,669
In my city we would keep the traffic
to the coloured.

99
00:11:10,880 --> 00:11:13,838
They're animals,
so let them lose their souls.

100
00:11:20,280 --> 00:11:24,239
I hoped that we could come here
and reason together.

101
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:31,758
And I'm willing to do whatever is
necessary to find a peaceful solution.

102
00:11:31,960 --> 00:11:36,272
We are agreed. The traffic in drugs
will be permitted, but controlled.

103
00:11:36,480 --> 00:11:40,678
Don Corleone will give us protection
in the east, and there will be peace.

104
00:11:40,880 --> 00:11:44,111
I must have strict assurance
from Corleone.

105
00:11:44,320 --> 00:11:47,630
As time goes by and his position
becomes stronger,

106
00:11:47,840 --> 00:11:50,195
will he attempt any individual vendetta?

107
00:11:50,400 --> 00:11:55,349
We are all reasonable men.
We don't have to give assurances.

108
00:11:55,560 --> 00:11:57,676
You talk about vengeance.

109
00:11:57,880 --> 00:12:00,838
Will vengeance bring your son
back to you?

110
00:12:01,040 --> 00:12:03,679
Or my boy to me?

111
00:12:03,880 --> 00:12:06,838
I forgo the vengeance of my son.

112
00:12:09,160 --> 00:12:12,038
But I have selfish reasons.

113
00:12:13,480 --> 00:12:17,439
My youngest son was forced
to leave this country...

114
00:12:18,720 --> 00:12:21,598
...because of this Sollozzo business.

115
00:12:21,800 --> 00:12:26,396
And I have to make arrangements
to bring him back here safely.

116
00:12:26,600 --> 00:12:29,194
Cleared of all these false charges.

117
00:12:30,520 --> 00:12:33,432
But I'm a superstitious man.

118
00:12:33,640 --> 00:12:39,829
If an unlucky accident should befall him,
if he should be shot by a police officer,

119
00:12:40,040 --> 00:12:43,350
or if he should hang himself
in his jail cell,

120
00:12:43,560 --> 00:12:47,314
or if he's struck by a bolt of lightning,

121
00:12:47,520 --> 00:12:51,479
then I'm going to blame
some of the people in this room.

122
00:12:52,400 --> 00:12:55,119
And that I do not forgive.

123
00:12:57,200 --> 00:12:59,668
But, that aside...

124
00:13:02,280 --> 00:13:04,953
...let me say that I swear...

125
00:13:06,160 --> 00:13:09,118
...on the souls of my grandchildren,

126
00:13:09,320 --> 00:13:13,996
that I will not be the one to break
the peace we've made here today.

127
00:13:37,840 --> 00:13:43,073
Should I insist that all of Tattaglia's
drug middlemen have clean records?

128
00:13:43,280 --> 00:13:45,999
Mention it. Don't insist.

129
00:13:47,240 --> 00:13:52,075
- Barzini will know without being told.
- You mean Tattaglia.

130
00:13:53,520 --> 00:13:58,719
Tattaglia's a pimp. He could never
have outfought Santino.

131
00:14:01,880 --> 00:14:07,750
But I didn't know until this day
that it was Barzini all along.

132
00:14:21,760 --> 00:14:23,830
Come on, Nancy.

133
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:28,037
Keep together, everyone. Brian.

134
00:14:28,760 --> 00:14:30,876
Okay, all right.

135
00:14:43,200 --> 00:14:45,668
How long have you been back?

136
00:14:45,880 --> 00:14:47,836
I've been back a year.

137
00:14:49,080 --> 00:14:51,719
Longer than that, I think.

138
00:14:53,480 --> 00:14:55,835
It's good to see you, Kay.

139
00:15:06,240 --> 00:15:09,198
I'm working for my father now, Kay.

140
00:15:11,160 --> 00:15:14,357
He's been sick. Very sick.

141
00:15:15,480 --> 00:15:21,749
But you're not like him. You told me you
weren't going to become like your father.

142
00:15:22,920 --> 00:15:27,118
My father is no different
than any other powerful man.

143
00:15:27,320 --> 00:15:31,552
Any man who's responsible
for other people.

144
00:15:31,760 --> 00:15:33,876
Like a senator or president.

145
00:15:34,080 --> 00:15:36,435
- How naive you sound.
- Why?

146
00:15:36,640 --> 00:15:39,359
They don't have men killed.

147
00:15:42,120 --> 00:15:44,315
Who's being naive, Kay?

148
00:15:45,560 --> 00:15:50,793
My father's way of doing things is over.
Even he knows that.

149
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:55,949
In five years the Corleone family
is going to be completely legitimate.

150
00:15:56,760 --> 00:16:01,197
Trust me. That's all I can tell you
about my business. Kay...

151
00:16:01,920 --> 00:16:05,469
Michael, why did you come here? Why?

152
00:16:06,280 --> 00:16:10,831
What do you want with me after all
this time? I've been calling and writing.

153
00:16:11,040 --> 00:16:14,271
I came because I need you.
I care for you.

154
00:16:14,480 --> 00:16:18,917
- Please stop it, Michael.
- Because... I want you to marry me.

155
00:16:19,760 --> 00:16:22,752
- It's too late.
- Please, Kay...

156
00:16:23,840 --> 00:16:27,879
I'll do anything you ask to make up for
what's happened to us.

157
00:16:29,600 --> 00:16:34,879
Because that's important, Kay.
Because what's important is that...

158
00:16:35,080 --> 00:16:39,392
...we have each other.
That we have a life together.

159
00:16:39,600 --> 00:16:42,797
That we have children. Our children.

160
00:16:43,880 --> 00:16:46,633
Kay, I need you.

161
00:16:47,720 --> 00:16:49,995
And I love you.

162
00:17:10,440 --> 00:17:14,035
Barzini's people chisel my territory
and we do nothing about it!

163
00:17:14,240 --> 00:17:17,550
- Soon I'll have no place to hang my hat!
- Be patient.

164
00:17:17,760 --> 00:17:20,718
I'm not asking for help.
Just take off the handcuffs.

165
00:17:20,920 --> 00:17:23,832
- Be patient.
- We must protect ourselves.

166
00:17:24,040 --> 00:17:27,271
- Let me recruit some new men.
- No.

167
00:17:27,480 --> 00:17:32,315
- Barzini would get an excuse to fight.
- Mike, you're wrong.

168
00:17:32,520 --> 00:17:34,112
Don Corleone...

169
00:17:34,360 --> 00:17:38,592
You once said that one day Tessio
and me could form our own family.

170
00:17:38,800 --> 00:17:42,952
Till today I would never think of it.
I must ask your permission.

171
00:17:43,160 --> 00:17:46,072
Michael is now head of the family.

172
00:17:46,280 --> 00:17:50,273
If he gives his permission,
then you have my blessing.

173
00:17:50,480 --> 00:17:52,436
After we make the move to Nevada

174
00:17:52,640 --> 00:17:56,952
you can leave the Corleone family
and go on your own.

175
00:17:57,160 --> 00:18:01,119
- How long will that be?
- Six months.

176
00:18:01,320 --> 00:18:07,156
Forgive me, but with you gone, me and
Pete will come under Barzini's thumb.

177
00:18:07,360 --> 00:18:12,593
I hate that Barzini. In six months' time
there will be nothing left to build on.

178
00:18:12,800 --> 00:18:15,633
- Do you have faith in my judgement?
- Yes.

179
00:18:15,840 --> 00:18:18,513
- Do I have your loyalty?
- Always, Godfather.

180
00:18:18,720 --> 00:18:21,996
Then be a friend to Michael.
Do as he says.

181
00:18:26,280 --> 00:18:31,513
Things are negotiated that'll solve your
problems and answer your questions.

182
00:18:31,720 --> 00:18:34,518
That's all I can tell you now.

183
00:18:34,720 --> 00:18:36,915
Carlo, you grew up in Nevada.

184
00:18:37,120 --> 00:18:40,351
When we make our move there,
you'll be my right-hand man.

185
00:18:40,560 --> 00:18:45,031
Tom Hagen is no longer <i>consigliere.</i>
He'll be our lawyer in Vegas.

186
00:18:45,240 --> 00:18:48,550
That's no reflection on Tom,
just how I want it.

187
00:18:48,760 --> 00:18:53,436
If I ever need help, who's a better
<i>consigliere</i> than my father? That's it.

188
00:19:11,040 --> 00:19:14,430
- Thank you, Poppa.
- I'm happy for you, Carlo.

189
00:19:15,200 --> 00:19:18,112
Mike... Why am I out?

190
00:19:19,440 --> 00:19:23,115
You're not a wartime <i>consigliere,</i> Tom.

191
00:19:23,320 --> 00:19:25,914
Things may get rough with the move.

192
00:19:26,480 --> 00:19:28,710
Tom.

193
00:19:32,640 --> 00:19:37,589
I advised Michael. I never thought
you were a bad <i>consigliere.</i>

194
00:19:37,800 --> 00:19:42,954
I thought Santino was a bad Don,
rest in peace.

195
00:19:43,160 --> 00:19:47,073
Michael has all my confidence,
just as you do.

196
00:19:47,280 --> 00:19:52,513
But there are reasons why you must
have no part in what is going to happen.

197
00:19:52,720 --> 00:19:56,190
- Maybe I could help.
- You're out, Tom.

198
00:20:43,080 --> 00:20:47,119
I can't get over the way your face looks.
So good!

199
00:20:47,320 --> 00:20:51,598
This doctor did some job. Did Kay
talk you into it? Hey, hey, hey!

200
00:20:51,800 --> 00:20:55,031
Leave them out here.
He's tired and wants to clean up.

201
00:20:55,240 --> 00:20:57,629
Let me open the door, all right?

202
00:21:03,960 --> 00:21:09,432
- Hello, Mike! Welcome to Las Vegas!
- All for you, kid! It's all his idea.

203
00:21:09,640 --> 00:21:12,279
- Your brother Freddy.
- Girls?

204
00:21:15,480 --> 00:21:18,995
I'll be right back. Keep them occupied.

205
00:21:19,760 --> 00:21:24,038
- Anything you want, kid, anything.
- Who are the girls?

206
00:21:24,240 --> 00:21:28,199
- That's for you to find out.
- Get rid of them, Fredo.

207
00:21:29,080 --> 00:21:33,551
- Hey, Mike...
- I'm here on business. Get rid of them.

208
00:21:33,760 --> 00:21:36,911
I'm tired. Get rid of the band too.

209
00:21:41,880 --> 00:21:44,838
Hey, take off. Take off. Let's go.

210
00:21:45,040 --> 00:21:47,998
Hey, that's it. Hey, Angelo.

211
00:21:48,760 --> 00:21:51,149
Hey, come on! Scram!

212
00:21:52,400 --> 00:21:56,678
Come on, honey. I don't know
what's the matter with him, Johnny.

213
00:21:56,880 --> 00:21:58,871
Sorry.

214
00:21:59,080 --> 00:22:01,674
I don't know. He's tired.

215
00:22:08,240 --> 00:22:11,038
What happened to Moe Greene?

216
00:22:11,240 --> 00:22:15,438
He had some business. He said to
give him a call when the party started.

217
00:22:15,640 --> 00:22:17,870
Well, give him a call.

218
00:22:18,680 --> 00:22:21,877
- Johnny, how are you?
- Nice to see you, Mike.

219
00:22:22,080 --> 00:22:24,036
- We're proud of you.
- Thanks.

220
00:22:24,240 --> 00:22:27,516
Sit down, I want to talk to you.
The Don is proud too.

221
00:22:27,720 --> 00:22:30,314
Well, I owe it all to him.

222
00:22:30,520 --> 00:22:35,389
He knows how grateful you are. That's
why he'd like to ask a favour of you.

223
00:22:35,600 --> 00:22:38,319
Mike, what can I do?

224
00:22:38,520 --> 00:22:44,311
We're thinking of giving up our interests
in the olive oil business and settle here.

225
00:22:44,520 --> 00:22:50,152
Moe will sell us his share of the casino
and the hotel, so we'll own all of it. Tom!

226
00:22:50,360 --> 00:22:55,195
Are you sure? Moe loves the business.
He never said nothing about selling.

227
00:22:55,400 --> 00:22:58,551
I'll make him an offer he can't refuse.

228
00:22:59,400 --> 00:23:01,550
See, Johnny...

229
00:23:01,760 --> 00:23:05,799
We figure that entertainment
would draw gamblers to the casino.

230
00:23:06,000 --> 00:23:09,959
We hope you'll sign a contract
to appear five times a year.

231
00:23:12,200 --> 00:23:16,955
Perhaps convince some of your friends
in the movies to do the same.

232
00:23:17,840 --> 00:23:20,115
We're counting on you.

233
00:23:21,840 --> 00:23:25,549
Sure, Mike. I'll do anything
for my godfather.

234
00:23:25,760 --> 00:23:27,159
Good.

235
00:23:28,400 --> 00:23:32,757
Hey, Mike! Hello, fellows.
Everybody's here. Freddy, Tom.

236
00:23:32,960 --> 00:23:34,916
- Good to see you.
- How are you, Moe?

237
00:23:35,120 --> 00:23:40,069
Have everything? Specially prepared
food, the best dancers, and good credit.

238
00:23:40,280 --> 00:23:44,068
Draw chips for everybody,
so they can play on the house.

239
00:23:46,120 --> 00:23:49,112
Is my credit good enough
to buy you out?

240
00:23:50,480 --> 00:23:51,799
Buy me out?

241
00:23:52,000 --> 00:23:57,199
The casino, the hotel. The
Corleone family wants to buy you out.

242
00:23:57,800 --> 00:24:02,999
The Corleone family wants to
buy me out? No, I buy you out.

243
00:24:03,200 --> 00:24:06,192
Your casino loses money.
We can do better.

244
00:24:06,400 --> 00:24:10,837
- You think I'm skimming off the top?
- You're unlucky.

245
00:24:14,800 --> 00:24:17,189
You Guineas make me laugh.

246
00:24:17,400 --> 00:24:22,599
I took Freddy in when you had a bad
time, and now you try to push me out!

247
00:24:22,800 --> 00:24:26,395
You did that because we bankrolled
your casino

248
00:24:26,600 --> 00:24:31,390
and the Molinari family guaranteed
his safety. Let's talk business.

249
00:24:31,600 --> 00:24:36,549
Yes. First of all, you're all done. You
don't have that kind of muscle anymore.

250
00:24:36,760 --> 00:24:40,912
The Godfather is sick. You're getting
chased out of New York by the others.

251
00:24:41,120 --> 00:24:44,669
Do you think you can come to my hotel
and take over?

252
00:24:44,880 --> 00:24:49,590
I talked to Barzini. I can make a deal
with him and still keep my hotel!

253
00:24:49,800 --> 00:24:53,031
Is that why you slapped my brother
around in public?

254
00:24:53,240 --> 00:24:57,791
That was nothing, Mike.
Moe didn't mean nothing by that.

255
00:24:58,000 --> 00:25:01,959
He flies off the handle sometimes,
but we're good friends.

256
00:25:02,160 --> 00:25:06,472
I have a business to run.
I've got to kick asses sometimes.

257
00:25:06,680 --> 00:25:10,389
We had an argument,
so I had to straighten him out.

258
00:25:10,600 --> 00:25:13,034
You straightened my brother out?

259
00:25:13,240 --> 00:25:17,518
He was banging cocktail waitresses!
Players couldn't get a drink.

260
00:25:17,720 --> 00:25:19,995
What's wrong with you?

261
00:25:24,040 --> 00:25:27,715
I leave for New York tomorrow.
Think about a price.

262
00:25:27,920 --> 00:25:29,353
Son-of-a-bitch!

263
00:25:29,560 --> 00:25:34,680
I'm Moe Greene! I made my bones
when you were out with cheerleaders.

264
00:25:34,880 --> 00:25:38,077
Wait a minute, Moe. I have an idea.

265
00:25:38,280 --> 00:25:41,636
Tom, you're the <i>consigliere.</i>
Talk to the Don...

266
00:25:41,840 --> 00:25:46,675
Just a minute. Don is semi-retired and
Mike is in charge of the family business.

267
00:25:46,880 --> 00:25:50,475
If you have anything to say,
say it to Michael.

268
00:25:53,640 --> 00:25:58,760
Mike, you don't come to Las Vegas and
talk to a man like Moe Greene like that!

269
00:26:00,280 --> 00:26:02,236
Fredo...

270
00:26:02,440 --> 00:26:05,398
You're my older brother, and I love you.

271
00:26:06,400 --> 00:26:10,837
But don't ever take sides with anyone
against the family again.

272
00:26:20,600 --> 00:26:25,037
I have to see my father and his people,
so have dinner without me.

273
00:26:26,240 --> 00:26:31,360
This weekend we'll go out. We'll go to
the city, see a show and have dinner.

274
00:26:37,920 --> 00:26:40,798
Your sister wants to ask you something.

275
00:26:41,000 --> 00:26:43,070
- Let her ask.
- She's afraid to.

276
00:26:43,280 --> 00:26:45,840
They want you to be godfather
to their boy.

277
00:26:46,040 --> 00:26:47,996
- We'll see.
- Will you?

278
00:26:48,200 --> 00:26:50,555
Let me think about it. Come on.

279
00:26:58,440 --> 00:27:01,318
Barzini will move against you first.

280
00:27:01,520 --> 00:27:05,718
He'll set up a meeting with someone
you absolutely trust.

281
00:27:05,920 --> 00:27:08,753
Guaranteeing your safety.

282
00:27:08,960 --> 00:27:12,316
And at that meeting
you'll be assassinated.

283
00:27:16,320 --> 00:27:19,710
I like to drink wine more than I used to.

284
00:27:20,560 --> 00:27:24,348
- Anyway, I'm drinking more.
- It's good for you, Pop.

285
00:27:28,840 --> 00:27:31,115
I don't know.

286
00:27:32,080 --> 00:27:35,595
Are you happy with your wife
and children?

287
00:27:35,800 --> 00:27:39,156
- Very happy.
- That's good.

288
00:27:40,320 --> 00:27:45,030
I hope you don't mind the way I keep
going over this Barzini business.

289
00:27:45,240 --> 00:27:48,596
- No, not at all.
- It's an old habit.

290
00:27:49,360 --> 00:27:52,511
I spend my life trying not to be careless.

291
00:27:53,760 --> 00:27:57,548
Women and children can be careless,
but not men.

292
00:28:00,240 --> 00:28:02,470
- How's your boy?
- He's good.

293
00:28:02,680 --> 00:28:05,513
He looks more like you every day.

294
00:28:07,920 --> 00:28:12,232
He's smarter than I am. He's three
and can read the funny papers.

295
00:28:14,120 --> 00:28:16,350
Read the funny papers.

296
00:28:22,920 --> 00:28:28,392
I want you to arrange for a telephone
man to check all in- and out-going calls.

297
00:28:28,600 --> 00:28:34,357
- I did it already. I took care of that, Pop.
- That's right. I forgot.

298
00:28:37,520 --> 00:28:40,080
What's the matter?

299
00:28:40,280 --> 00:28:42,635
What's bothering you?

300
00:28:45,400 --> 00:28:49,951
I'll handle it. I told you I can handle it,
so I'll handle it.

301
00:29:02,600 --> 00:29:06,559
I knew that Santino would have to
go through all this.

302
00:29:06,840 --> 00:29:09,638
And Fredo...

303
00:29:11,120 --> 00:29:13,350
Fredo was, well...

304
00:29:14,800 --> 00:29:18,236
But I never wanted this for you.

305
00:29:19,680 --> 00:29:24,549
I worked my whole life. I don't apologise
for taking care of my family.

306
00:29:24,760 --> 00:29:28,469
And I refused to be a fool,

307
00:29:28,680 --> 00:29:32,832
dancing on a string
held by all those big shots.

308
00:29:34,400 --> 00:29:38,359
I don't apologise. That's my life,
but I thought that...

309
00:29:39,280 --> 00:29:44,513
...that when it was your time, you would
be the one to hold the strings.

310
00:29:46,080 --> 00:29:51,359
Senator Corleone. Governor Corleone.
Something.

311
00:29:51,560 --> 00:29:53,869
Another <i>pezzo da novanta.</i>

312
00:29:54,600 --> 00:29:55,999
Well...

313
00:29:59,040 --> 00:30:02,919
Just wasn't enough time, Michael.
Wasn't enough time.

314
00:30:03,120 --> 00:30:06,795
We'll get there, Pop. We'll get there.

315
00:30:11,000 --> 00:30:15,232
Now listen, whoever comes to you
with this Barzini meeting,

316
00:30:15,440 --> 00:30:18,716
he's the traitor. Don't forget that.

317
00:30:34,480 --> 00:30:36,789
Can I hold it, please?

318
00:30:50,960 --> 00:30:54,669
- Can I water these?
- Yes, go ahead.

319
00:30:54,880 --> 00:30:57,872
Over here, over here.

320
00:30:59,320 --> 00:31:02,517
Be careful. You're spilling it.

321
00:31:07,840 --> 00:31:09,796
Antony!

322
00:31:10,000 --> 00:31:11,991
Come here, come here.

323
00:31:15,520 --> 00:31:18,239
That's it. We'll put it right there.

324
00:31:23,840 --> 00:31:26,991
I'll show you something. Come here.

325
00:31:28,200 --> 00:31:30,156
Stand there.

326
00:31:33,440 --> 00:31:35,829
Give me an orange!

327
00:31:53,120 --> 00:31:55,111
That's a new trick.

328
00:31:55,680 --> 00:31:58,558
You run in there. Run in there.

329
00:32:10,720 --> 00:32:12,950
Where are you?

330
00:35:03,040 --> 00:35:05,838
Mike, can I have a minute?

331
00:35:14,920 --> 00:35:17,115
Barzini wants to arrange a meeting.

332
00:35:17,320 --> 00:35:21,108
He says we can straighten out
any of our problems.

333
00:35:21,320 --> 00:35:24,312
- You talked to him?
- Yeah.

334
00:35:24,520 --> 00:35:28,911
I can arrange security. On my territory.

335
00:35:31,200 --> 00:35:34,192
- All right?
- All right.

336
00:35:50,520 --> 00:35:53,478
Do you know how they're going to
come at you?

337
00:35:55,680 --> 00:35:59,992
They're arranging a meeting
in Brooklyn. Tessio's ground.

338
00:36:01,120 --> 00:36:03,350
Where I'll be safe.

339
00:36:14,720 --> 00:36:18,269
I always thought it would be
Clemenza, not Tessio.

340
00:36:18,480 --> 00:36:22,792
It's the smart move.
Tessio was always smarter.

341
00:36:24,600 --> 00:36:26,591
But I'm going to wait.

342
00:36:26,800 --> 00:36:28,995
After the baptism.

343
00:36:30,640 --> 00:36:33,359
I've decided to be godfather
to Connie's baby.

344
00:36:34,320 --> 00:36:37,232
And then I'll meet with Don Barzini

345
00:36:37,440 --> 00:36:42,275
and Tattaglia.
All the heads of the five families.

346
00:38:58,000 --> 00:39:02,073
Michael, do you believe in God, the
Father, Creator of Heaven and Earth?

347
00:39:02,280 --> 00:39:03,554
I do.

348
00:39:03,760 --> 00:39:06,991
<i>Do you believe in Jesus Christ,</i>
<i>His only Son, our Lord?</i>

349
00:39:07,200 --> 00:39:08,474
<i>I do.</i>

350
00:39:08,680 --> 00:39:12,434
<i>Do you believe in the Holy Ghost,</i>
<i>the Holy Catholic Church?</i>

351
00:39:12,640 --> 00:39:13,914
<i>I do.</i>

352
00:40:16,120 --> 00:40:20,671
Michael Francis Rizzi,
do you renounce Satan?

353
00:40:26,680 --> 00:40:27,954
I do renounce him.

354
00:40:37,280 --> 00:40:38,679
And all his works?

355
00:40:51,440 --> 00:40:52,953
I do renounce them.

356
00:40:54,280 --> 00:40:55,759
Oh, God!

357
00:40:58,560 --> 00:41:02,155
- And all his pomps?
- I do renounce them.

358
00:41:17,120 --> 00:41:20,749
Michael Rizzi, will you be baptised?

359
00:41:20,960 --> 00:41:22,393
I will.

360
00:41:29,120 --> 00:41:35,150
Michael Rizzi, go in peace, and may
the Lord be with you. Amen.

361
00:41:47,880 --> 00:41:49,836
Kay!

362
00:41:50,040 --> 00:41:52,031
Kiss your godfather.

363
00:42:15,160 --> 00:42:20,757
Can't go to Vegas. Something's come
up. Everybody has to leave without us.

364
00:42:20,960 --> 00:42:24,157
- Mike, it's our first vacation!
- Connie, please.

365
00:42:24,360 --> 00:42:28,319
Go back to the house, wait for my call.
It's important.

366
00:42:28,520 --> 00:42:30,795
I'll only be a couple of days.

367
00:42:46,200 --> 00:42:49,033
We're on our way to Brooklyn.

368
00:42:50,280 --> 00:42:54,592
- I hope Mike can get us a good deal.
- I'm sure he will.

369
00:43:01,440 --> 00:43:06,560
Sal, Tom, the boss says he'll come in a
separate car, so you two go on ahead.

370
00:43:06,760 --> 00:43:10,196
- That screws up my arrangements.
- That's what he said.

371
00:43:10,400 --> 00:43:12,834
I can't go either, Sal.

372
00:43:23,720 --> 00:43:28,475
Tell Mike it was only business.
I always liked him.

373
00:43:28,680 --> 00:43:32,116
- He understands that.
- Excuse me, Sal.

374
00:43:37,680 --> 00:43:40,797
Tom, can you get me off the hook?

375
00:43:41,000 --> 00:43:44,879
- For old times' sake?
- Can't do it, Sally.

376
00:44:27,760 --> 00:44:30,274
You have to answer for Santino, Carlo.

377
00:44:35,320 --> 00:44:39,757
- Mike, you got it all wrong.
- You fingered Sonny for Barzini.

378
00:44:39,960 --> 00:44:43,430
That little farce you played
with my sister.

379
00:44:43,640 --> 00:44:48,475
- You think that could fool a Corleone?
- I'm innocent. I swear on the kids.

380
00:44:48,680 --> 00:44:51,831
- Please, don't do this.
- Sit down.

381
00:44:53,960 --> 00:44:56,633
Don't do this to me, please.

382
00:45:04,960 --> 00:45:07,110
Barzini is dead.

383
00:45:08,560 --> 00:45:10,790
So is Philip Tattaglia.

384
00:45:12,040 --> 00:45:13,632
Moe Greene.

385
00:45:14,360 --> 00:45:18,512
Strachi. Cuneo.

386
00:45:19,800 --> 00:45:24,749
Today I settle all family business,
so don't tell me you're innocent, Carlo.

387
00:45:24,960 --> 00:45:27,394
Admit what you did.

388
00:45:30,400 --> 00:45:32,516
Get him a drink.

389
00:45:38,160 --> 00:45:40,355
Come on.

390
00:45:40,560 --> 00:45:45,475
Don't be afraid, Carlo. Do you think
I'd make my sister a widow?

391
00:45:46,800 --> 00:45:49,758
I'm godfather to your son, Carlo.

392
00:45:56,000 --> 00:45:58,673
Go ahead, drink, drink.

393
00:46:02,800 --> 00:46:07,237
No, you're out of the family business.
That's your punishment.

394
00:46:07,440 --> 00:46:11,194
You're finished.
I'm putting you on a plane to Vegas.

395
00:46:11,400 --> 00:46:12,879
Tom.

396
00:46:16,800 --> 00:46:20,395
I want you to stay there. Understand?

397
00:46:20,600 --> 00:46:23,239
Only don't tell me you're innocent.

398
00:46:24,000 --> 00:46:28,710
Because it insults my intelligence.
Makes me very angry.

399
00:46:32,200 --> 00:46:35,158
Who approached you?

400
00:46:35,360 --> 00:46:37,920
Tattaglia or Barzini?

401
00:46:44,960 --> 00:46:47,520
It was Barzini.

402
00:46:50,680 --> 00:46:52,636
Good.

403
00:46:58,040 --> 00:47:01,999
There's a car waiting outside
to take you to the airport.

404
00:47:02,200 --> 00:47:05,909
I'll call your wife and tell her
what flight you're on.

405
00:47:10,240 --> 00:47:12,834
- Mike...
- Get out of my sight.

406
00:47:36,880 --> 00:47:38,233
Hello, Carlo.

407
00:48:34,840 --> 00:48:39,072
- I'm trying to tell you...
- Mama, please!

408
00:48:47,440 --> 00:48:48,998
Michael!

409
00:48:49,200 --> 00:48:52,237
- What is it?
- Where is he?

410
00:48:53,480 --> 00:48:58,270
Michael, you lousy bastard!
You killed my husband.

411
00:48:58,480 --> 00:49:02,268
You waited until Papa died,
so nobody could stop you.

412
00:49:02,480 --> 00:49:05,438
You blamed him for Sonny.
Everybody did.

413
00:49:05,640 --> 00:49:11,397
But you never thought about me!
Now what are we going to do?

414
00:49:11,600 --> 00:49:13,238
Connie.

415
00:49:14,800 --> 00:49:20,113
Why do you think he kept Carlo at the
Mall? He knew he was going to kill him.

416
00:49:20,320 --> 00:49:25,599
And you stood godfather to our baby.
You lousy cold-hearted bastard!

417
00:49:25,800 --> 00:49:29,713
Want to know how many men he had
killed with Carlo? Read the papers!

418
00:49:29,920 --> 00:49:33,230
That's your husband,
that's your husband!

419
00:49:41,520 --> 00:49:45,195
No! No, no...

420
00:49:45,400 --> 00:49:48,915
Take her upstairs. Get her a doctor.

421
00:50:09,080 --> 00:50:10,911
She's hysterical.

422
00:50:15,200 --> 00:50:17,077
Hysterical.

423
00:50:18,800 --> 00:50:21,360
Michael, is it true?

424
00:50:22,240 --> 00:50:25,710
- Don't ask me about my business, Kay.
- Is it true?

425
00:50:25,920 --> 00:50:29,469
Don't ask me about my business.
Enough!

426
00:50:47,720 --> 00:50:49,438
All right.

427
00:50:51,880 --> 00:50:53,836
This one time.

428
00:50:57,400 --> 00:51:01,359
This one time I'll let you ask me
about my affairs.

429
00:51:06,360 --> 00:51:09,079
Is it true?

430
00:51:11,800 --> 00:51:13,552
Is it?

431
00:51:15,000 --> 00:51:16,433
No.

432
00:51:29,560 --> 00:51:32,711
I guess we both need a drink. Come on.

433
00:52:02,240 --> 00:52:04,549
Don Corleone.
