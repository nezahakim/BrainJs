1
00:00:21,298 --> 00:00:23,186
When I meet with the Tattaglia
people, should I insist...

2
00:00:23,300 --> 00:00:26,656
that all these drug middlemen
have clean records?

3
00:00:26,771 --> 00:00:28,898
Mention it.
Don't insist.

4
00:00:31,108 --> 00:00:33,474
Barzini is a man who'll know that
without being told.

5
00:00:34,945 --> 00:00:37,539
You mean Tattaglia.

6
00:00:37,648 --> 00:00:40,378
Tattaglia's a pimp.

7
00:00:40,484 --> 00:00:42,714
He never could've
outfought Santino.

8
00:00:46,323 --> 00:00:49,986
But I didn't know until this day
that it was...

9
00:00:50,094 --> 00:00:52,153
Barzini all along.

10
00:01:07,244 --> 00:01:08,802
Come on, Nancy.

11
00:01:10,448 --> 00:01:12,871
Keep together, everyone.
Brian?

12
00:01:14,318 --> 00:01:15,876
All right.

13
00:01:29,366 --> 00:01:31,891
How long have you been back?

14
00:01:32,002 --> 00:01:33,890
I've been back a year.

15
00:01:35,439 --> 00:01:37,964
Longer than that, I think.

16
00:01:40,211 --> 00:01:42,099
It's good to see you, Kay.

17
00:01:48,619 --> 00:01:50,644
Hi, Miss Adams!

18
00:01:53,457 --> 00:01:55,345
I'm working for my father now.

19
00:01:58,596 --> 00:02:00,518
He's been sick.

20
00:02:00,631 --> 00:02:02,963
Very sick.

21
00:02:03,067 --> 00:02:05,058
But you're not like him.

22
00:02:05,169 --> 00:02:07,694
I thought you weren't going
to become a man like your father.

23
00:02:07,805 --> 00:02:09,329
That's what you told me.

24
00:02:10,841 --> 00:02:13,571
My father's no different
than any other powerful man.

25
00:02:15,246 --> 00:02:18,807
Any man who's responsible
for other people.

26
00:02:19,917 --> 00:02:22,306
Like a senator or a president.

27
00:02:22,419 --> 00:02:24,944
- Do you know how naive you sound?
- Why?

28
00:02:25,055 --> 00:02:27,649
Senators and presidents
don't have men killed.

29
00:02:30,995 --> 00:02:32,826
Who's being naive?

30
00:02:34,131 --> 00:02:36,258
My father's way
of doing things is over.

31
00:02:36,367 --> 00:02:39,859
It's finished.
Even he knows that.

32
00:02:39,970 --> 00:02:41,892
I mean, in five years
the Corleone family...

33
00:02:42,006 --> 00:02:43,997
is going to be
completely legitimate.

34
00:02:46,277 --> 00:02:49,132
Trust me. That's all I can tell you
about my business.

35
00:02:51,615 --> 00:02:53,879
Why did you come here?

36
00:02:53,984 --> 00:02:56,077
Why?

37
00:02:56,187 --> 00:02:58,143
What do you want with me
after all this time...

38
00:02:58,255 --> 00:03:00,780
without even calling or writing?

39
00:03:00,891 --> 00:03:02,779
I came here because I need you.

40
00:03:02,893 --> 00:03:05,418
- Because I care for you.
- Please stop it.

41
00:03:05,529 --> 00:03:08,657
Because I want you to marry me.

42
00:03:10,167 --> 00:03:12,158
- It's too late.
- Please.

43
00:03:14,371 --> 00:03:18,228
I'll do anything you ask to make up
for what's happened to us.

44
00:03:20,044 --> 00:03:22,274
Because that's important.

45
00:03:22,379 --> 00:03:25,871
Because what's important is that...

46
00:03:25,983 --> 00:03:27,712
we have each other.

47
00:03:27,818 --> 00:03:30,707
That we have a life together.

48
00:03:30,821 --> 00:03:34,279
That we have children-
our children.

49
00:03:36,427 --> 00:03:39,157
I need you...

50
00:03:39,263 --> 00:03:41,151
and I love you.

51
00:04:02,886 --> 00:04:04,774
Barzini's people
chisel my territory...

52
00:04:04,888 --> 00:04:06,651
and we do nothing about it.

53
00:04:06,757 --> 00:04:09,385
Soon, there won't be one place
in Brooklyn I can hang my hat.

54
00:04:09,493 --> 00:04:12,018
- Just be patient.
- I'm not askin' you for help.

55
00:04:12,129 --> 00:04:14,654
- Just take off the handcuffs.
- Be patient.

56
00:04:14,765 --> 00:04:16,790
We gotta protect ourselves.

57
00:04:16,900 --> 00:04:18,788
Give me a chance to recruit
some new men.

58
00:04:18,902 --> 00:04:20,426
No.

59
00:04:20,537 --> 00:04:23,028
I don't wanna give Barzini
an excuse to start fighting.

60
00:04:23,107 --> 00:04:25,632
Mike, you're wrong.

61
00:04:25,743 --> 00:04:29,372
Don Corleone,
you once said the day would come...

62
00:04:29,480 --> 00:04:32,176
when Tessio and me
could form our own family.

63
00:04:32,283 --> 00:04:34,171
Till today,
I would never think of it.

64
00:04:34,285 --> 00:04:36,549
I must ask your permission.

65
00:04:36,654 --> 00:04:39,885
Well, Michael is now
head of the family...

66
00:04:39,990 --> 00:04:42,686
and if he gives his permission,
then you have my blessing.

67
00:04:44,261 --> 00:04:46,752
After we make the move to Nevada...

68
00:04:46,864 --> 00:04:49,856
you can break off from the Corleone
family and go on your own.

69
00:04:49,967 --> 00:04:52,765
- After we make the move to Nevada.
- How long will that be?

70
00:04:54,004 --> 00:04:55,528
Six months.

71
00:04:55,639 --> 00:04:59,097
Forgive me, Godfather,
but with you gone...

72
00:04:59,209 --> 00:05:02,167
me and Pete'll come under
Barzini's thumb sooner or later.

73
00:05:02,279 --> 00:05:04,702
And I hate that goddamn Barzini.

74
00:05:04,815 --> 00:05:07,739
In six months' time, there won't be
nothing left to build on.

75
00:05:07,851 --> 00:05:10,843
- You have faith in my judgment?
- Yes.

76
00:05:10,954 --> 00:05:13,752
- Do I have your loyalty?
- Always, Godfather.

77
00:05:13,857 --> 00:05:16,018
Then be a friend to Michael...

78
00:05:16,126 --> 00:05:18,014
and do as he says.

79
00:05:22,066 --> 00:05:24,159
There are things being negotiated
that are gonna solve...

80
00:05:24,268 --> 00:05:27,362
all your problems
and answer all your questions.

81
00:05:27,471 --> 00:05:29,359
That's all I can tell you now.

82
00:05:30,474 --> 00:05:33,102
Carlo, you grew up in Nevada.

83
00:05:33,210 --> 00:05:36,373
When we make our move there,
you're gonna be my right-hand man.

84
00:05:36,480 --> 00:05:39,176
Tom Hagen's no longer consigliere.

85
00:05:39,283 --> 00:05:41,672
He's gonna be our lawyer in Vegas.

86
00:05:41,785 --> 00:05:44,151
That's no reflection on Tom,
but that's the way I want it.

87
00:05:44,254 --> 00:05:46,085
Besides, if I ever need help...

88
00:05:46,190 --> 00:05:48,385
who's a better consigliere
than my father?

89
00:05:48,492 --> 00:05:50,050
That's it.

90
00:06:09,079 --> 00:06:11,274
- Thank you, Papa.
- I'm happy for you, Carlo.

91
00:06:14,985 --> 00:06:17,215
Why am I out?

92
00:06:17,321 --> 00:06:19,312
You're not a wartime consigliere.

93
00:06:21,392 --> 00:06:23,883
Things may get rough
with the move we're trying.

94
00:06:31,168 --> 00:06:33,329
I advised Michael.

95
00:06:33,437 --> 00:06:36,326
I never thought
you were a bad consigliere.

96
00:06:36,440 --> 00:06:39,705
I thought Santino was a bad Don...

97
00:06:39,810 --> 00:06:41,971
rest in peace.

98
00:06:42,079 --> 00:06:45,105
Michael has all my confidence,
as you do.

99
00:06:46,316 --> 00:06:49,843
But there are reasons why
you must have no part...

100
00:06:49,953 --> 00:06:52,080
of what is going to happen.

101
00:06:52,189 --> 00:06:53,588
Maybe I could help.

102
00:06:53,690 --> 00:06:55,453
You're out.

103
00:07:44,608 --> 00:07:47,133
I can't get over the way
your face looks.

104
00:07:47,244 --> 00:07:50,407
It really looks good.
This doctor did some job.

105
00:07:50,514 --> 00:07:53,142
Who talked you into it, Kay?
Hey, hey, wait.

106
00:07:53,250 --> 00:07:55,548
Leave them out here.
We'll deal with them later.

107
00:07:55,652 --> 00:07:57,540
He's tired.
He wants to clean up.

108
00:07:57,654 --> 00:08:00,714
Now, let me open the door.

109
00:08:06,263 --> 00:08:08,493
Hello, Mike.
Welcome to Las Vegas.

110
00:08:08,599 --> 00:08:11,864
All for you, kid.
It was all his idea, right?

111
00:08:11,969 --> 00:08:14,767
- Well, your brother, Freddy-
- It was- Girls?

112
00:08:18,509 --> 00:08:21,307
I'll be right back.
You keep them occupied.

113
00:08:21,411 --> 00:08:24,335
That a boy.
Anything you want, kid.

114
00:08:24,448 --> 00:08:26,336
Who are the girls?

115
00:08:27,518 --> 00:08:29,406
That's for you to find out.

116
00:08:29,520 --> 00:08:32,375
Get rid of them.

117
00:08:32,489 --> 00:08:34,514
- Hey, Mike-
- I'm here on business.

118
00:08:34,625 --> 00:08:38,356
I leave tomorrow.
Now, get rid of them. I'm tired.

119
00:08:38,462 --> 00:08:40,350
Get rid of the band too.

120
00:08:45,936 --> 00:08:48,734
Hey, just take off.
Come on. Let's go.

121
00:08:48,839 --> 00:08:52,104
Hey, that's it.
Angelo, that's it.

122
00:08:52,209 --> 00:08:54,131
Let's go.
Hey, come on!

123
00:08:54,244 --> 00:08:55,643
Scram!

124
00:08:57,014 --> 00:08:59,278
Come on, honey. Let's go.
I don't know, Johnny.

125
00:08:59,383 --> 00:09:01,442
I don't know what the hell's
the matter with him.

126
00:09:01,552 --> 00:09:03,747
It's all right, Freddy.

127
00:09:03,854 --> 00:09:06,049
I don't know.
He's tired, he's hot.

128
00:09:13,363 --> 00:09:15,251
What happened to Moe Greene?

129
00:09:16,466 --> 00:09:18,855
He said he had some business.
He said give him a call...

130
00:09:18,969 --> 00:09:20,834
when the party started.

131
00:09:20,938 --> 00:09:22,826
Well, give him a call.

132
00:09:24,241 --> 00:09:27,335
- Johnny, how are you?
- Hello. Nice to see you again.

133
00:09:27,444 --> 00:09:29,503
- We're all proud of you.
- Thanks, Mike.

134
00:09:29,613 --> 00:09:31,911
Sit down, Johnny.
I want to talk to you.

135
00:09:32,015 --> 00:09:36,440
- The Don's proud of you too.
- I owe it all to him.

136
00:09:36,553 --> 00:09:38,475
Well, he knows
how grateful you are.

137
00:09:38,589 --> 00:09:41,649
That's why he'd like to ask
a favor of you.

138
00:09:41,758 --> 00:09:43,646
Mike, what can I do?

139
00:09:45,062 --> 00:09:47,553
The Corleone family is thinking
of giving up all its interests...

140
00:09:47,631 --> 00:09:51,021
in the olive oil business,
settling out here.

141
00:09:51,134 --> 00:09:54,399
Now, Moe Greene will sell us
his share of the casino and hotel...

142
00:09:54,504 --> 00:09:57,098
so it can be completely owned
by the family.

143
00:09:57,207 --> 00:09:59,402
Mike, are you sure about that?

144
00:09:59,509 --> 00:10:02,364
Moe loves the business. He never
said nothin' to me about sellin'.

145
00:10:02,479 --> 00:10:04,777
I'll make him an offer
he can't refuse.

146
00:10:06,717 --> 00:10:09,049
See, Johnny...

147
00:10:09,152 --> 00:10:11,347
we figure that entertainment
will be a big factor...

148
00:10:11,455 --> 00:10:13,150
in drawing gamblers to the casino.

149
00:10:13,256 --> 00:10:16,555
We hope you'll sign a contract
to appear five times a year.

150
00:10:20,063 --> 00:10:23,328
Perhaps convince some of
your friends in the movies...

151
00:10:23,433 --> 00:10:25,924
to do the same.

152
00:10:26,003 --> 00:10:27,891
We're counting on you.

153
00:10:30,107 --> 00:10:32,632
Sure, Mike.
I'll do anything for my godfather.

154
00:10:32,743 --> 00:10:33,971
You know that.

155
00:10:34,077 --> 00:10:35,476
Good.

156
00:10:36,713 --> 00:10:38,840
Hey, Mike.
Hello, fellas.

157
00:10:38,949 --> 00:10:42,646
Everybody's here. Freddy, Tom.
Good to see you, Mike.

158
00:10:42,753 --> 00:10:44,675
- How are you, Moe?
- You got everything you want?

159
00:10:44,788 --> 00:10:47,484
The chef cooked for you special, the
dancers will kick your tongue out...

160
00:10:47,591 --> 00:10:49,252
and your credit is good.

161
00:10:49,359 --> 00:10:51,987
Draw chips for everybody in the room
so they can play on the house.

162
00:10:55,565 --> 00:10:57,453
My credit good enough
to buy you out?

163
00:11:00,037 --> 00:11:01,868
Buy me out?

164
00:11:01,972 --> 00:11:04,634
The casino.
The hotel.

165
00:11:04,741 --> 00:11:07,505
The Corleone family
wants to buy you out.

166
00:11:07,611 --> 00:11:10,466
The Corleone family
wants to buy me out?

167
00:11:10,580 --> 00:11:13,003
No, I buy you out.
You don't buy me out.

168
00:11:13,116 --> 00:11:16,381
Your casino loses money.
Maybe we can do better.

169
00:11:16,486 --> 00:11:18,078
You think I'm skimming
off the top?

170
00:11:19,790 --> 00:11:20,950
You're unlucky.

171
00:11:25,462 --> 00:11:27,828
You goddamn guineas
really make me laugh.

172
00:11:27,931 --> 00:11:30,764
I do you a favor and take Freddy in
when you're having a bad time.

173
00:11:30,867 --> 00:11:33,233
- Then you try to push me out!
- Wait a minute.

174
00:11:33,336 --> 00:11:35,930
You took Freddy in because
the Corleone family...

175
00:11:36,039 --> 00:11:38,530
bankrolled your casino because
the Molinari family...

176
00:11:38,642 --> 00:11:40,667
on the coast
guaranteed his safety.

177
00:11:40,777 --> 00:11:42,733
Now, we're talkin' business.
Let's talk business.

178
00:11:42,846 --> 00:11:45,576
Let's talk business.
First of all, you're all done.

179
00:11:45,682 --> 00:11:48,048
The Corleone family don't have
that kind of muscle anymore.

180
00:11:48,151 --> 00:11:50,574
The Godfather's sick. You're
getting chased out of New York...

181
00:11:50,687 --> 00:11:52,382
by Barzini and the other families.

182
00:11:52,489 --> 00:11:56,380
You think you can come to my hotel
and take over?

183
00:11:56,493 --> 00:11:58,222
I talked to Barzini.

184
00:11:58,328 --> 00:12:01,593
I can make a deal with him
and still keep my hotel.

185
00:12:01,698 --> 00:12:04,292
Is that why you slapped
my brother around in public?

186
00:12:05,669 --> 00:12:07,261
That was nothin'.

187
00:12:07,370 --> 00:12:09,930
Moe didn't mean nothin' by that.

188
00:12:10,040 --> 00:12:12,429
Sure he flies off the handle
once in a while...

189
00:12:12,542 --> 00:12:14,567
but Moe and me,
we're good friends, right?

190
00:12:14,678 --> 00:12:16,441
I got a business to run.

191
00:12:16,546 --> 00:12:19,276
I gotta kick asses sometimes
to make it run right.

192
00:12:19,382 --> 00:12:23,375
We had a little argument,
so I had to straighten him out.

193
00:12:23,487 --> 00:12:26,081
You straightened my brother out?

194
00:12:26,189 --> 00:12:28,578
He was banging cocktail waitresses
two at a time!

195
00:12:28,692 --> 00:12:31,581
Players couldn't get a drink.
What's wrong with you?

196
00:12:37,634 --> 00:12:41,126
I leave for New York tomorrow.
Think about a price.

197
00:12:41,238 --> 00:12:42,830
Son of a bitch.

198
00:12:42,939 --> 00:12:45,965
Do you know who I am?
I'm Moe Greene.

199
00:12:46,076 --> 00:12:48,670
I made my bones when you were
going out with cheerleaders.

200
00:12:48,779 --> 00:12:50,667
Wait a minute.
I got an idea.

201
00:12:52,282 --> 00:12:55,479
Tom, you're the consigliere.
You can talk to the Don.

202
00:12:55,585 --> 00:12:57,473
- You can explain-
- Just a minute.

203
00:12:57,587 --> 00:13:01,182
The Don is semiretired. Mike is
in charge of the business now.

204
00:13:01,291 --> 00:13:03,851
If you have anything to say,
say it to Michael.

205
00:13:09,733 --> 00:13:13,328
You don't come to Las Vegas
and talk to Moe Greene like that!

206
00:13:17,674 --> 00:13:20,404
You're my older brother,
and I love you.

207
00:13:21,912 --> 00:13:23,868
But don't ever take sides
with anyone...

208
00:13:23,980 --> 00:13:26,869
against the family again...

209
00:13:26,983 --> 00:13:28,746
ever.

210
00:13:36,293 --> 00:13:38,352
I have to see my father
and his people.

211
00:13:38,461 --> 00:13:40,349
Have dinner without me.

212
00:13:42,465 --> 00:13:44,626
This weekend we'll go out.
We'll go to the city.

213
00:13:44,734 --> 00:13:47,100
We'll see a show and have dinner.
I promise.

214
00:13:54,678 --> 00:13:57,567
Your sister wants
to ask you something.

215
00:13:57,681 --> 00:13:59,706
- Let her ask.
- She's afraid to.

216
00:13:59,816 --> 00:14:03,047
Connie and Carlo want you to be
godfather to their little boy.

217
00:14:03,153 --> 00:14:04,916
- We'll see.
- Will you?

218
00:14:05,021 --> 00:14:06,909
Let me think about it.
Come on.

219
00:14:14,130 --> 00:14:15,961
So...

220
00:14:16,066 --> 00:14:19,024
Barzini will move
against you first.

221
00:14:19,135 --> 00:14:23,458
He'll set up a meeting with
someone that you absolutely trust...

222
00:14:23,573 --> 00:14:25,404
guaranteeing your safety.

223
00:14:26,910 --> 00:14:30,175
And at that meeting,
you'll be assassinated.

224
00:14:34,818 --> 00:14:38,015
I like to drink wine
more than I used to.

225
00:14:39,189 --> 00:14:41,248
Anyway, I'm drinking more.

226
00:14:41,358 --> 00:14:43,246
It's good for you, Pop.

227
00:14:47,797 --> 00:14:49,355
I don't know.

228
00:14:51,201 --> 00:14:53,089
Your wife and children,
are you happy with them?

229
00:14:55,105 --> 00:14:57,061
Very happy.

230
00:14:57,173 --> 00:14:59,698
That's good.

231
00:14:59,809 --> 00:15:01,970
I hope you don't mind
the way I-

232
00:15:02,078 --> 00:15:04,672
I keep going over
this Barzini business.

233
00:15:04,781 --> 00:15:06,737
No, not at all.

234
00:15:06,850 --> 00:15:09,114
It's an old habit.

235
00:15:09,219 --> 00:15:11,983
I spent my life
tryin' not to be careless.

236
00:15:13,857 --> 00:15:16,690
Women and children can be careless,
but not men.

237
00:15:20,563 --> 00:15:23,123
- How's your boy?
- He's good.

238
00:15:23,233 --> 00:15:25,292
You know, he looks
more like you every day.

239
00:15:28,538 --> 00:15:30,699
He's smarter than I am.

240
00:15:30,807 --> 00:15:32,695
Three years old,
he can read the funny papers.

241
00:15:35,111 --> 00:15:37,067
He reads the funny papers.

242
00:15:44,354 --> 00:15:46,743
I want you to arrange
to have a telephone man...

243
00:15:46,856 --> 00:15:49,984
check all the calls that go
in and out of here.

244
00:15:50,093 --> 00:15:52,118
- I did it already.
- Could be anyone.

245
00:15:52,228 --> 00:15:55,755
- I took care of that.
- That's right. I forgot.

246
00:15:59,469 --> 00:16:01,767
What's the matter?

247
00:16:01,871 --> 00:16:03,429
What's bothering you?

248
00:16:07,143 --> 00:16:08,701
I'll handle it.

249
00:16:10,046 --> 00:16:12,037
I told you I can handle it,
I'll handle it.

250
00:16:25,595 --> 00:16:29,918
I knew that Santino was gonna
have to go through all this...

251
00:16:30,033 --> 00:16:31,830
and Fredo-

252
00:16:31,935 --> 00:16:34,301
Well...

253
00:16:34,404 --> 00:16:36,497
Fredo was-

254
00:16:38,441 --> 00:16:41,205
But I never wanted this for you.

255
00:16:43,480 --> 00:16:46,313
I worked my whole life-
I don't apologize-

256
00:16:46,416 --> 00:16:48,475
to take care of my family...

257
00:16:48,585 --> 00:16:52,442
and I refused to be a fool...

258
00:16:52,555 --> 00:16:56,616
dancing on a string
held by all those big shots.

259
00:16:58,728 --> 00:17:01,891
I don't apologize. That's my life.
But I thought that-

260
00:17:03,867 --> 00:17:06,461
that when it was your time...

261
00:17:06,569 --> 00:17:08,867
you would be the one
to hold the strings.

262
00:17:10,907 --> 00:17:13,205
Senator Corleone.

263
00:17:14,377 --> 00:17:16,436
Governor Corleone.
Something.

264
00:17:16,546 --> 00:17:18,070
Another pezzonovante.

265
00:17:24,554 --> 00:17:28,376
Just wasn't enough time.
Wasn't enough time.

266
00:17:28,491 --> 00:17:31,085
We'll get there, Pop.

267
00:17:31,194 --> 00:17:32,923
We'll get there.

268
00:17:36,933 --> 00:17:41,290
Listen, whoever comes to you
with this Barzini meeting...

269
00:17:41,404 --> 00:17:43,065
he's the traitor.

270
00:17:43,173 --> 00:17:44,731
Don't forget that.

271
00:18:01,424 --> 00:18:03,312
Put it over the tree.

272
00:18:18,708 --> 00:18:21,074
- Can I water these?
- Yeah.

273
00:18:21,177 --> 00:18:22,667
That's fine.

274
00:18:22,745 --> 00:18:25,236
Over here.
Over here.

275
00:18:27,350 --> 00:18:29,238
Be careful.
You're spilling it.

276
00:18:36,159 --> 00:18:37,854
Anthony, come here.

277
00:18:44,067 --> 00:18:46,490
Go ahead. That's right.
We'll put it right there.

278
00:18:52,375 --> 00:18:54,673
I'll show you something.
Come here.

279
00:18:57,380 --> 00:18:59,075
Now, you stand there.

280
00:19:02,986 --> 00:19:04,544
Give me an orange!

281
00:19:23,072 --> 00:19:24,960
That's a new trick.

282
00:19:26,142 --> 00:19:28,702
You run in there.
Run in there.

283
00:19:41,324 --> 00:19:43,713
- Where are you?
- Who?

284
00:20:16,960 --> 00:20:18,518
Ouch!

285
00:22:41,003 --> 00:22:42,959
Mike, can I have a minute?

286
00:22:53,850 --> 00:22:56,216
Barzini wants to arrange a meeting.

287
00:22:56,319 --> 00:22:58,810
He says we can straighten
any of our problems out.

288
00:23:00,490 --> 00:23:02,355
- You talked to him?
- Yeah.

289
00:23:03,926 --> 00:23:06,258
I can arrange security...

290
00:23:06,362 --> 00:23:07,920
on my territory.

291
00:23:10,800 --> 00:23:12,688
All right?

292
00:23:12,802 --> 00:23:15,635
- All right.
- All right.

293
00:23:30,920 --> 00:23:32,808
Do you know how
they're gonna come at you?

294
00:23:36,359 --> 00:23:38,691
They're arranging a meeting
in Brooklyn.

295
00:23:38,795 --> 00:23:40,353
Tessio's ground...

296
00:23:42,165 --> 00:23:43,962
where I'll be safe.

297
00:23:56,212 --> 00:23:59,807
I always thought it would've been
Clemenza, not Tessio.

298
00:23:59,916 --> 00:24:02,180
It's the smart move.

299
00:24:02,285 --> 00:24:04,173
Tessio was always smarter.

300
00:24:05,988 --> 00:24:08,183
But I'm gonna wait.

301
00:24:08,291 --> 00:24:09,849
After the baptism.

302
00:24:12,762 --> 00:24:15,322
I've decided to be godfather
to Connie's baby.

303
00:24:16,666 --> 00:24:19,590
And then I'll meet
with Don Barzini...

304
00:24:19,702 --> 00:24:22,068
and Tattaglia...

305
00:24:22,171 --> 00:24:24,537
all the heads
of the five families.

306
00:26:45,948 --> 00:26:48,837
Michael, do you believe in God,
the Father Almighty...

307
00:26:48,951 --> 00:26:51,909
- creator of Heaven and Earth?
- I do.

308
00:26:52,021 --> 00:26:55,320
Do you believe in Jesus Christ,
His only Son, our Lord?

309
00:26:55,424 --> 00:26:56,823
I do.

310
00:26:56,926 --> 00:27:01,090
Do you believe in the Holy Ghost,
the Holy Catholic Church?

311
00:27:01,197 --> 00:27:02,596
I do.

312
00:28:07,396 --> 00:28:12,322
Michael Francis Rizzi,
do you renounce Satan?

313
00:28:18,441 --> 00:28:19,931
I do renounce him.

314
00:28:29,552 --> 00:28:31,042
And all his works?

315
00:28:44,266 --> 00:28:45,927
I do renounce them.

316
00:28:51,640 --> 00:28:55,599
- And all his pomps?
- I do renounce them.

317
00:29:10,993 --> 00:29:15,054
Michael Rizzi,
will you be baptized?

318
00:29:15,164 --> 00:29:16,688
I will.

319
00:29:24,206 --> 00:29:26,766
Michael Rizzi, go in peace.

320
00:29:26,876 --> 00:29:29,902
And may the Lord be with you.
Amen.

321
00:30:12,021 --> 00:30:13,909
- Carlo.
- What?

322
00:30:14,023 --> 00:30:16,150
Can't go to Vegas.
Something's come up.

323
00:30:16,258 --> 00:30:18,180
Everybody's gonna have to leave
without us.

324
00:30:18,294 --> 00:30:20,854
- It's our first vacation together.
- Connie, please.

325
00:30:20,963 --> 00:30:22,851
- What do you wanna do?
- Go back to the house.

326
00:30:22,965 --> 00:30:25,820
Wait for my call.
It's important.

327
00:30:25,935 --> 00:30:27,823
I'll only be a couple of days.

328
00:30:30,873 --> 00:30:32,761
Have a nice trip, Mama.

329
00:30:44,386 --> 00:30:46,274
We're on our way to Brooklyn.

330
00:30:48,724 --> 00:30:51,022
I hope Mike can get us
a good deal tonight.

331
00:30:51,126 --> 00:30:52,753
I'm sure he will.

332
00:31:00,369 --> 00:31:03,395
Sal, Tom, the boss says
he'll come in a separate car.

333
00:31:03,505 --> 00:31:05,598
He says for you two
to go on ahead.

334
00:31:05,708 --> 00:31:08,336
He can't do that.
It screws up all my arrangements.

335
00:31:08,444 --> 00:31:10,776
- That's what he said.
- I can't go either, Sal.

336
00:31:23,559 --> 00:31:26,323
Tell Mike it was only business.

337
00:31:26,428 --> 00:31:28,089
I always liked him.

338
00:31:29,098 --> 00:31:31,362
- He understands that.
- Excuse me, Sal.

339
00:31:38,007 --> 00:31:39,895
Can you get me off the hook?

340
00:31:41,610 --> 00:31:44,306
- For old times' sake.
- Can't do it, Sally.

341
00:32:30,259 --> 00:32:32,523
You have to answer
for Santino, Carlo.

342
00:32:37,666 --> 00:32:39,395
You got it all wrong.

343
00:32:39,501 --> 00:32:41,389
You fingered Sonny
for the Barzini people.

344
00:32:43,605 --> 00:32:46,665
That little farce you played
with my sister.

345
00:32:46,775 --> 00:32:48,663
Did you think that could fool
a Corleone?

346
00:32:48,777 --> 00:32:51,940
I'm innocent.
I swear on the kids.

347
00:32:52,047 --> 00:32:53,935
- Please, don't do this to me.
- Sit down.

348
00:32:57,686 --> 00:32:59,574
Don't do this to me, please.

349
00:33:09,064 --> 00:33:10,622
Barzini's dead.

350
00:33:12,735 --> 00:33:14,623
So is Phillip Tattaglia...

351
00:33:16,438 --> 00:33:17,735
Moe Greene...

352
00:33:18,941 --> 00:33:20,340
Strachi...

353
00:33:22,011 --> 00:33:23,410
Cuneo.

354
00:33:24,580 --> 00:33:28,072
Today I settle all family business,
so don't tell me you're innocent.

355
00:33:29,952 --> 00:33:31,908
Admit what you did.

356
00:33:35,591 --> 00:33:37,479
Get him a drink.

357
00:33:43,732 --> 00:33:46,064
Come on.

358
00:33:46,168 --> 00:33:48,466
Don't be afraid.

359
00:33:48,570 --> 00:33:50,936
You think I'd make my sister
a widow?

360
00:33:52,708 --> 00:33:54,801
I'm godfather to your son.

361
00:34:02,351 --> 00:34:03,579
Go ahead, drink.

362
00:34:03,685 --> 00:34:05,983
Drink.

363
00:34:09,258 --> 00:34:11,317
No, you're out
of the family business.

364
00:34:11,427 --> 00:34:15,090
That's your punishment.
You're finished.

365
00:34:15,197 --> 00:34:17,620
I'm putting you on a plane to Vegas.

366
00:34:23,939 --> 00:34:27,329
I want you to stay there.
Understand?

367
00:34:27,443 --> 00:34:29,707
Only don't tell me
you're innocent...

368
00:34:31,513 --> 00:34:34,471
because it insults my intelligence.

369
00:34:34,583 --> 00:34:36,471
It makes me very angry.

370
00:34:39,988 --> 00:34:43,219
Now, who approached you?

371
00:34:43,325 --> 00:34:44,883
Tattaglia or Barzini?

372
00:34:52,968 --> 00:34:54,333
It was Barzini.

373
00:34:57,906 --> 00:34:59,897
Good.

374
00:35:07,049 --> 00:35:09,711
There's a car waiting for you
outside to take you to the airport.

375
00:35:11,153 --> 00:35:13,644
I'll call your wife,
tell her what flight you're on.

376
00:35:19,261 --> 00:35:21,252
- Please, can I-
- Get out of my sight.

377
00:35:47,222 --> 00:35:48,519
Hello, Carlo.

378
00:36:46,248 --> 00:36:49,046
Will you stop crying?
What are you trying to tell me?

379
00:36:49,151 --> 00:36:51,949
- I'm telling you you're wrong.
- Mama, please!

380
00:37:02,864 --> 00:37:04,422
Where is he?

381
00:37:07,269 --> 00:37:12,297
Michael, you lousy bastard!
You killed my husband!

382
00:37:12,407 --> 00:37:15,001
You waited until Papa died
so nobody could stop you...

383
00:37:15,110 --> 00:37:16,543
and then you killed him!

384
00:37:16,645 --> 00:37:19,773
You blamed him for Sonny.
You always did. Everybody did.

385
00:37:19,881 --> 00:37:23,510
But you never thought about me!
You never gave a damn about me!

386
00:37:23,619 --> 00:37:25,610
Now what am I gonna do?

387
00:37:29,825 --> 00:37:32,316
Why do you think
he kept Carlo at the mall?

388
00:37:32,394 --> 00:37:34,954
All the time he knew
he was gonna kill him.

389
00:37:35,063 --> 00:37:38,157
And you stood godfather
to our baby.

390
00:37:38,267 --> 00:37:40,497
You lousy, coldhearted bastard.

391
00:37:40,602 --> 00:37:43,025
Want to know how many men
he had killed with Carlo?

392
00:37:43,138 --> 00:37:44,799
Read the papers!
Read the papers!

393
00:37:44,906 --> 00:37:47,397
That's your husband!
That's your husband!

394
00:38:00,989 --> 00:38:03,412
Take her upstairs.

395
00:38:03,525 --> 00:38:05,652
- Get her a doctor.
- Oh, God!

396
00:38:26,081 --> 00:38:27,708
She's hysterical.

397
00:38:32,521 --> 00:38:34,113
Hysterical.

398
00:38:36,024 --> 00:38:37,218
Is it true?

399
00:38:39,961 --> 00:38:41,917
Don't ask me about my business.

400
00:38:42,030 --> 00:38:45,522
- Is it true?
- Don't ask me about my business.

401
00:38:45,634 --> 00:38:47,556
Enough!

402
00:39:06,521 --> 00:39:08,079
All right.

403
00:39:10,826 --> 00:39:12,384
This one time.

404
00:39:16,531 --> 00:39:19,022
This one time, I'll let you
ask me about my affairs.

405
00:39:25,574 --> 00:39:27,064
Is it true?

406
00:39:31,680 --> 00:39:33,011
Is it?

407
00:39:49,698 --> 00:39:51,996
I guess we both need a drink, huh?

408
00:39:52,100 --> 00:39:53,658
Come on.

409
00:40:24,166 --> 00:40:25,724
Don Corleone.
