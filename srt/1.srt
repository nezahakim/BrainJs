1
00:00:48,528 --> 00:00:51,361
I believe in America.

2
00:00:51,498 --> 00:00:54,433
America has made my fortune.

3
00:00:54,568 --> 00:00:58,629
And I raised my daughter
in the American fashion.

4
00:00:58,772 --> 00:01:03,505
I gave her freedom, but I taught her
never to dishonour her family.

5
00:01:04,978 --> 00:01:08,038
She found a boyfriend, not an Italian.

6
00:01:08,181 --> 00:01:12,675
She went to the movies with him.
She stayed out late.

7
00:01:12,819 --> 00:01:14,514
I didn't protest.

8
00:01:15,522 --> 00:01:20,255
Two months ago he took her for a drive
with another boyfriend.

9
00:01:21,261 --> 00:01:23,923
They made her drink whiskey

10
00:01:24,064 --> 00:01:28,296
and then they tried to
take advantage of her.

11
00:01:28,435 --> 00:01:32,735
She resisted, she kept her honour.

12
00:01:33,874 --> 00:01:37,640
So they beat her like an animal.

13
00:01:38,812 --> 00:01:43,715
When I went to the hospital,
her nose was broken,

14
00:01:43,850 --> 00:01:48,583
her jaw was shattered,
held together by wire.

15
00:01:50,457 --> 00:01:53,858
She couldn't even weep
because of the pain.

16
00:01:55,962 --> 00:01:59,523
But I wept. Why did I weep?

17
00:02:02,068 --> 00:02:04,866
She was the light of my life.

18
00:02:06,440 --> 00:02:08,169
Beautiful girl.

19
00:02:11,912 --> 00:02:14,847
Now she will never be beautiful again.

20
00:02:21,455 --> 00:02:23,446
Sorry.

21
00:02:31,031 --> 00:02:35,627
I went to the police,
like a good American.

22
00:02:35,769 --> 00:02:38,431
These two boys were brought to trial.

23
00:02:39,539 --> 00:02:44,602
The judge sentenced them to three years
in prison, but suspended the sentence.

24
00:02:45,679 --> 00:02:50,981
Suspended the sentence!
They went free that very day!

25
00:02:52,986 --> 00:02:56,251
I stood in the courtroom like a fool.

26
00:02:56,389 --> 00:03:00,120
Those two bastards, they smiled at me.

27
00:03:01,161 --> 00:03:07,122
Then I said to my wife, "For justice,
we must go to Don Corleone."

28
00:03:12,138 --> 00:03:16,438
Why did you go to the police?
Why didn't you come to me first?

29
00:03:16,576 --> 00:03:22,674
What do you want of me? Tell me
anything, but do what I beg you to do.

30
00:03:22,816 --> 00:03:24,477
What is that?

31
00:03:35,428 --> 00:03:37,259
I want them dead.

32
00:03:49,109 --> 00:03:50,440
That I cannot do.

33
00:03:52,178 --> 00:03:54,669
I'll give you anything you ask.

34
00:03:57,017 --> 00:04:02,580
I've known you many years, but this
is the first time you've asked for help.

35
00:04:03,590 --> 00:04:08,926
I can't remember the last time
you invited me for a cup of coffee.

36
00:04:09,996 --> 00:04:13,693
Even though my wife is godmother
to your only child.

37
00:04:13,833 --> 00:04:18,770
But let's be frank here.
You never wanted my friendship.

38
00:04:18,905 --> 00:04:22,636
And you were afraid to be in my debt.

39
00:04:22,776 --> 00:04:25,210
I didn't want to get into trouble.

40
00:04:26,313 --> 00:04:29,077
I understand.

41
00:04:29,215 --> 00:04:32,116
You found Paradise in America.

42
00:04:34,421 --> 00:04:39,222
You made a good living, had police
protection and there were courts of law.

43
00:04:39,359 --> 00:04:42,055
You didn't need a friend like me.

44
00:04:43,697 --> 00:04:47,189
But now you come to me and say,

45
00:04:47,334 --> 00:04:50,167
"Don Corleone, give me justice."

46
00:04:51,571 --> 00:04:54,438
But you don't ask with respect.

47
00:04:54,574 --> 00:05:00,012
You don't offer friendship. You don't
even think to call me Godfather.

48
00:05:01,047 --> 00:05:07,953
You come on my daughter's wedding
day and ask me to murder for money.

49
00:05:08,088 --> 00:05:10,579
I ask you for justice.

50
00:05:10,724 --> 00:05:13,522
That is not justice.
Your daughter is alive.

51
00:05:14,628 --> 00:05:18,496
Let them suffer, then, as she suffers.

52
00:05:20,200 --> 00:05:22,498
How much shall I pay you?

53
00:05:37,183 --> 00:05:41,119
Bonasera, Bonasera.

54
00:05:41,254 --> 00:05:45,315
What have I ever done to make you
treat me so disrespectfully?

55
00:05:46,359 --> 00:05:48,953
If you'd come in friendship,

56
00:05:49,095 --> 00:05:53,498
the scum that ruined your daughter
would be suffering this very day.

57
00:05:54,601 --> 00:05:59,937
And if an honest man like you should
make enemies, they'd be my enemies.

58
00:06:02,776 --> 00:06:05,609
And then they would fear you.

59
00:06:09,149 --> 00:06:11,242
Be my friend?

60
00:06:15,121 --> 00:06:17,180
Godfather?

61
00:06:21,094 --> 00:06:22,288
Good.

62
00:06:24,330 --> 00:06:29,529
Some day, and that day may never
come, I'll ask a service of you.

63
00:06:30,937 --> 00:06:33,098
But until that day...

64
00:06:34,741 --> 00:06:39,041
...accept this justice as a gift
on my daughter's wedding day.

65
00:06:39,179 --> 00:06:41,739
- Grazie, Godfather.
- Prego.

66
00:06:48,722 --> 00:06:51,691
Give this to Clemenza.

67
00:06:53,727 --> 00:06:57,219
I want people that aren't going to
get carried away.

68
00:06:57,363 --> 00:07:01,527
We're not murderers,
in spite of what this undertaker says.

69
00:07:26,760 --> 00:07:30,196
- Where's Michael?
- Don't worry, he'll be here.

70
00:07:31,397 --> 00:07:34,127
We're not taking the picture
without Michael.

71
00:07:40,740 --> 00:07:43,470
- What's the matter?
- It's Michael.

72
00:08:32,859 --> 00:08:34,520
Don Barzini.

73
00:08:51,077 --> 00:08:54,205
Hey, Paulie! Let me have some wine.

74
00:08:54,347 --> 00:08:56,577
Paulie! More wine.

75
00:08:58,284 --> 00:09:03,688
- You look terrific on the floor.
- Are you a dance judge or something?

76
00:09:03,823 --> 00:09:05,882
Take a walk and do your job.

77
00:09:13,666 --> 00:09:16,931
Sandra, watch the kids.
Don't let them run wild.

78
00:09:17,070 --> 00:09:20,005
You watch yourself, all right?

79
00:09:40,793 --> 00:09:44,854
20, 30 grand. In small bills, cash.

80
00:09:45,832 --> 00:09:47,959
In that little silk purse.

81
00:09:48,101 --> 00:09:51,867
If this were somebody else's wedding...
Sfortunato!

82
00:09:52,005 --> 00:09:54,405
Hey, Paulie!

83
00:09:57,176 --> 00:09:58,370
Stupid jerk!

84
00:10:07,387 --> 00:10:09,321
What's the matter?

85
00:10:21,734 --> 00:10:24,100
- Have to go back to work.
- Tom.

86
00:10:24,237 --> 00:10:28,469
No Sicilian can refuse any request
on his daughter's wedding day.

87
00:10:34,213 --> 00:10:39,344
Don Corleone, I'm honoured and
grateful that you have invited me.

88
00:10:43,756 --> 00:10:47,453
Get out of here!
It's a private party. Go on!

89
00:10:48,461 --> 00:10:51,430
What is it? It's my sister's wedding.

90
00:10:58,037 --> 00:11:01,302
Goddamn FBI don't respect nothing!

91
00:11:03,743 --> 00:11:06,337
Come here, come here, come here!

92
00:11:21,227 --> 00:11:25,857
...but towards the end, he was paroled
to help with the American war effort,

93
00:11:25,999 --> 00:11:29,025
so for six months he's worked
in my pastry shop.

94
00:11:29,168 --> 00:11:31,864
Nazorine, what can I do for you?

95
00:11:32,005 --> 00:11:33,939
Now that the war is over,

96
00:11:34,073 --> 00:11:37,975
this boy, Enzo, they want to
repatriate him back to Italy.

97
00:11:38,111 --> 00:11:43,139
Godfather, I have a daughter.
You see, she and Enzo...

98
00:11:44,217 --> 00:11:48,711
You want Enzo to stay in this country,
and your daughter to be married.

99
00:11:49,856 --> 00:11:52,120
You understand everything.

100
00:11:53,026 --> 00:11:55,392
Mr Hagen. Thank you.

101
00:11:58,731 --> 00:12:02,462
Wait till you see the wedding cake
I made for your daughter!

102
00:12:02,602 --> 00:12:05,366
The bride, the groom and the angel...

103
00:12:10,543 --> 00:12:15,037
- Who should I give this job to?
- Not to our paisà.

104
00:12:15,181 --> 00:12:20,483
Give it to a Jew Congressman in
another district. Who else is on the list?

105
00:12:27,493 --> 00:12:29,085
Hey, Michael!

106
00:12:48,848 --> 00:12:52,284
He's not on the list,
but Luca Brasi wants to see you.

107
00:12:58,057 --> 00:13:00,389
Is this necessary?

108
00:13:00,526 --> 00:13:05,088
He didn't expect to be invited to the
wedding, so he wanted to thank you.

109
00:13:06,566 --> 00:13:12,163
Don Corleone, I'm honoured and
grateful that you have invited me

110
00:13:12,305 --> 00:13:17,538
on the wedding day of your daughter.
May their first child be a masculine child.

111
00:13:18,611 --> 00:13:20,044
Michael...

112
00:13:21,848 --> 00:13:25,011
That man over there
is talking to himself.

113
00:13:25,151 --> 00:13:28,211
See that scary guy over there?

114
00:13:28,354 --> 00:13:31,790
- He's a very scary guy.
- What's his name?

115
00:13:31,924 --> 00:13:36,361
His name is Luca Brasi.
He helps my father out sometimes.

116
00:13:37,730 --> 00:13:40,631
Michael, he's coming over here!

117
00:13:45,471 --> 00:13:47,302
You look terrific!

118
00:13:47,440 --> 00:13:50,705
My brother Tom Hagen,
Miss Kay Adams.

119
00:13:52,345 --> 00:13:54,643
Your father's been asking for you.

120
00:13:54,780 --> 00:13:57,613
- Very nice to meet you.
- Nice to meet you.

121
00:13:59,418 --> 00:14:02,046
Why does your brother
have a different name?

122
00:14:02,188 --> 00:14:05,851
My brother Sonny found Tom Hagen
in the street.

123
00:14:05,992 --> 00:14:10,588
He had no home,
so my father took him in.

124
00:14:11,831 --> 00:14:14,732
He's been with us ever since.

125
00:14:14,867 --> 00:14:16,835
He's a good lawyer.

126
00:14:17,837 --> 00:14:22,331
Not a Sicilian. I think he's
going to be consigliere.

127
00:14:22,475 --> 00:14:25,376
- What's that?
- That's a...

128
00:14:25,511 --> 00:14:29,140
...like a counsellor, an advisor.
Very important for the family.

129
00:14:30,249 --> 00:14:32,376
You like your lasagne?

130
00:14:36,722 --> 00:14:38,883
Don Corleone.

131
00:14:39,025 --> 00:14:41,516
I'm honoured and grateful

132
00:14:41,661 --> 00:14:45,620
that you have invited me
to your daughter's wedding.

133
00:14:50,603 --> 00:14:53,731
On the day of your daughter's wedding.

134
00:14:53,873 --> 00:14:59,106
And I hope that their first child
will be a masculine child.

135
00:15:00,213 --> 00:15:05,617
I pledge my ever-ending loyalty.

136
00:15:07,320 --> 00:15:12,280
- For your daughter's bridal purse.
- Thank you, Luca. Most valued friend.

137
00:15:12,792 --> 00:15:17,923
Don Corleone, I'm going to leave you
now, because I know you're busy.

138
00:15:18,497 --> 00:15:19,862
Thank you.

139
00:16:09,482 --> 00:16:11,814
Signora Corleone!

140
00:16:11,951 --> 00:16:14,010
No!

141
00:17:24,824 --> 00:17:29,852
Senator Cauley apologised for not
coming, but said you'd understand.

142
00:17:29,995 --> 00:17:34,227
Also some of the judges.
They've all sent gifts.

143
00:17:37,269 --> 00:17:38,566
What is that outside?

144
00:17:47,613 --> 00:17:50,582
Johnny! Johnny!

145
00:17:53,219 --> 00:17:54,880
I love you!

146
00:18:05,030 --> 00:18:08,557
He came all the way from California.
I told you he'd come!

147
00:18:08,701 --> 00:18:12,193
- He's probably in trouble again.
- He's a good godson.

148
00:18:13,038 --> 00:18:17,702
Johnny, Johnny! Sing a song!

149
00:18:33,025 --> 00:18:35,926
You never said you knew
Johnny Fontane!

150
00:18:36,061 --> 00:18:39,997
- Sure. You want to meet him?
- Great! Sure.

151
00:18:40,132 --> 00:18:44,034
- My father helped him with his career.
- He did?

152
00:18:44,170 --> 00:18:45,262
How?

153
00:18:47,273 --> 00:18:49,673
- Let's listen to this song.
- Michael...

154
00:19:23,776 --> 00:19:25,937
Please, Michael. Tell me.

155
00:19:29,748 --> 00:19:34,583
When Johnny was starting out, he was
signed to a personal service contract

156
00:19:34,720 --> 00:19:37,553
with a big bandleader.

157
00:19:37,690 --> 00:19:42,821
And as his career got better and better,
he wanted to get out of it.

158
00:19:42,962 --> 00:19:45,453
Johnny is my father's godson.

159
00:19:45,598 --> 00:19:49,034
My father went to see this bandleader.

160
00:19:49,168 --> 00:19:53,002
He offered him 1 0,000 dollars
to let Johnny go,

161
00:19:53,138 --> 00:19:55,800
but the bandleader said no.

162
00:19:55,941 --> 00:20:01,311
So the next day my father went to see
him, but this time with Luca Brasi.

163
00:20:03,249 --> 00:20:05,410
Within an hour,

164
00:20:05,551 --> 00:20:11,319
he signed a release
for a certified cheque of 1,000 dollars.

165
00:20:12,925 --> 00:20:16,725
- How did he do that?
- Made him an offer he couldn't refuse.

166
00:20:18,564 --> 00:20:23,433
- What was that?
- Luca Brasi held a gun to his head,

167
00:20:23,569 --> 00:20:28,802
and father said that either his brains or
his signature would be on the contract.

168
00:20:33,812 --> 00:20:35,507
That's a true story.

169
00:20:46,759 --> 00:20:49,523
That's my family, Kay. It's not me.

170
00:21:02,041 --> 00:21:03,770
Beautiful!

171
00:21:36,141 --> 00:21:38,109
I'll take care of it.

172
00:21:38,243 --> 00:21:40,108
Tom...

173
00:21:40,245 --> 00:21:43,840
I want you to find Santino.
Tell him to come to the office.

174
00:21:51,156 --> 00:21:54,057
How are you, Fredo?

175
00:21:54,193 --> 00:21:56,787
My brother Fredo,
this is Kay Adams.

176
00:21:57,830 --> 00:22:00,298
- Hi.
- How are you doing?

177
00:22:02,167 --> 00:22:06,570
- This is my brother Mike.
- Are you having a good time?

178
00:22:06,705 --> 00:22:09,173
Yeah. This is your friend?

179
00:22:09,308 --> 00:22:14,678
I don't know what to do.
My voice is weak. It's weak.

180
00:22:15,781 --> 00:22:22,084
Anyway, if I had this part in the picture,
it puts me right back on top again.

181
00:22:22,221 --> 00:22:27,625
But this... man won't give it to me,
the head of the studio.

182
00:22:27,760 --> 00:22:30,854
- What's his name?
- Woltz.

183
00:22:30,996 --> 00:22:35,433
He won't give it to me,
and he says there's no chance.

184
00:22:39,371 --> 00:22:40,668
Sonny?

185
00:22:42,307 --> 00:22:43,399
Sonny?

186
00:22:50,015 --> 00:22:51,107
Sonny?

187
00:22:52,084 --> 00:22:54,712
- Sonny, are you in there?
- What?

188
00:22:54,853 --> 00:22:56,377
The old man wants you.

189
00:22:58,057 --> 00:22:59,752
One minute.

190
00:23:14,239 --> 00:23:19,108
A month ago he bought the movie rights
to this book, a best-seller.

191
00:23:19,244 --> 00:23:22,702
The main character
is a guy just like me.

192
00:23:22,848 --> 00:23:25,510
I wouldn't even have to act.

193
00:23:26,618 --> 00:23:29,485
Godfather, I don't know what to do.

194
00:23:30,723 --> 00:23:35,023
You can act like a man!
What's the matter with you?

195
00:23:35,160 --> 00:23:40,826
Is this how you turned out a Hollywood
finocchio, that cries like a woman?

196
00:23:40,966 --> 00:23:44,766
"What can I do? What can I do?"
What is that nonsense?

197
00:23:44,903 --> 00:23:46,734
Ridiculous.

198
00:23:51,343 --> 00:23:54,540
- You spend time with your family?
- Sure I do.

199
00:23:54,680 --> 00:23:56,170
Good.

200
00:23:56,315 --> 00:24:01,582
Because a man who doesn't spend time
with his family can never be a real man.

201
00:24:06,692 --> 00:24:10,128
You look terrible. I want you to eat.

202
00:24:10,262 --> 00:24:15,495
Rest, and in a month this Hollywood
big shot will give you what you want.

203
00:24:15,634 --> 00:24:18,797
It's too late, they start shooting
in a week.

204
00:24:18,937 --> 00:24:22,065
I'm going to make him an offer
he can't refuse.

205
00:24:24,910 --> 00:24:29,870
Just go outside and enjoy yourself,
and forget about all this nonsense.

206
00:24:32,351 --> 00:24:35,411
- I want you to leave it all to me.
- All right.

207
00:25:00,212 --> 00:25:05,411
- What time does my daughter leave?
- Soon, after they cut the cake.

208
00:25:05,551 --> 00:25:08,918
Do we give your son-in-law
something important?

209
00:25:09,054 --> 00:25:14,424
Never. Give him a living, but never
discuss the family business with him.

210
00:25:14,560 --> 00:25:17,358
- What else?
- Virgil Sollozzo called.

211
00:25:17,496 --> 00:25:21,933
- We'll have to see him next week.
- When you come back from California.

212
00:25:23,368 --> 00:25:26,735
- When am I going to California?
- Tonight.

213
00:25:26,872 --> 00:25:32,276
I want you to talk to this movie big shot
and settle this business for Johnny.

214
00:25:33,278 --> 00:25:37,715
If there's nothing else, I'd like to go
to my daughter's wedding.

215
00:25:39,551 --> 00:25:42,520
Carlo, we're going to take the picture.

216
00:25:43,689 --> 00:25:45,418
Wait a minute.

217
00:25:45,557 --> 00:25:47,957
No, Michael. Not me.

218
00:25:52,297 --> 00:25:55,494
Okay, that's it. Just like that. Hold it!

219
00:27:45,277 --> 00:27:48,713
- You need a little more heat on that arc.
- Start talking.

220
00:27:48,847 --> 00:27:52,078
I was sent by a friend
of Johnny Fontane.

221
00:27:52,217 --> 00:27:55,846
This friend would give
his friendship to Mr Woltz,

222
00:27:55,988 --> 00:27:58,616
if Mr Woltz would grant us a favour.

223
00:27:58,757 --> 00:28:01,055
Woltz is listening.

224
00:28:01,193 --> 00:28:05,687
Give Johnny the part in that war film
you're starting next week.

225
00:28:10,969 --> 00:28:15,997
And what favour would your friend
grant Mr Woltz?

226
00:28:16,141 --> 00:28:19,542
He could make your future union
problems disappear.

227
00:28:19,678 --> 00:28:23,739
And one of your stars has just moved
from marijuana to heroin.

228
00:28:23,882 --> 00:28:28,148
Are you trying to muscle me?
Listen, you son-of-a-bitch!

229
00:28:28,286 --> 00:28:32,689
Let me lay it on the line. Johnny
Fontane will never get that movie!

230
00:28:32,824 --> 00:28:37,454
No matter how many Dago Guinea
greaseballs come out of the woodwork!

231
00:28:37,596 --> 00:28:41,430
- I'm German-lrish.
- Listen here, my Kraut-Mick friend.

232
00:28:41,566 --> 00:28:45,866
- I'm going to make trouble for you!
- I'm a lawyer. I haven't threatened...

233
00:28:46,004 --> 00:28:49,371
I know New York's big lawyers.
Who are you?

234
00:28:49,508 --> 00:28:54,878
I have a special practice. I handle
one client. I'll wait for your call.

235
00:28:56,882 --> 00:28:59,851
By the way, I admire your pictures
very much.

236
00:29:04,589 --> 00:29:06,989
Check him out.

237
00:29:28,547 --> 00:29:31,107
- It's really beautiful.
- Look at this.

238
00:29:31,249 --> 00:29:35,743
- It used to decorate a king's palace.
- Very nice.

239
00:29:35,887 --> 00:29:38,253
Why didn't you say
you work for Corleone?

240
00:29:38,390 --> 00:29:42,724
I thought you were some cheap hustler
Johnny was running in.

241
00:29:42,861 --> 00:29:46,024
- I only use his name when necessary.
- How's your drink?

242
00:29:46,164 --> 00:29:49,565
- Fine.
- Now I'll show you something beautiful.

243
00:29:49,701 --> 00:29:52,602
You do appreciate beauty, don't you?

244
00:29:55,240 --> 00:29:58,232
There you are.
600,000 dollars on four hoofs.

245
00:29:58,376 --> 00:30:02,005
I bet Russian czars never paid
that for a single horse.

246
00:30:02,147 --> 00:30:03,671
Khartoum.

247
00:30:04,683 --> 00:30:05,945
Khartoum.

248
00:30:07,352 --> 00:30:11,721
I'm not going to race him, though.
I'm going to put him out to stud.

249
00:30:13,358 --> 00:30:14,689
Thanks, Tony.

250
00:30:15,560 --> 00:30:18,586
Let's get something to eat.

251
00:30:18,730 --> 00:30:21,995
Corleone is Johnny's godfather.

252
00:30:22,134 --> 00:30:26,594
To the Italian people that's
a very sacred, close relationship.

253
00:30:26,738 --> 00:30:32,074
I respect it. Tell him to ask me anything
else. This favour I can't give him.

254
00:30:32,978 --> 00:30:36,379
He never asks a second favour
when he's been refused the first.

255
00:30:36,515 --> 00:30:42,545
You don't understand. Johnny Fontane
never gets that movie.

256
00:30:42,687 --> 00:30:46,453
That part is perfect for him.
It'll make him a big star.

257
00:30:46,591 --> 00:30:50,357
I'm going to run him out of the business,
and let me tell you why.

258
00:30:52,597 --> 00:30:57,296
Johnny Fontane ruined one of Woltz
International's most valuable protégés.

259
00:30:57,435 --> 00:31:02,771
We trained her for five years.
Singing, acting, dancing lessons.

260
00:31:02,908 --> 00:31:07,470
I spent hundreds of thousands of dollars
on her, to make her a big star.

261
00:31:07,612 --> 00:31:10,274
Let me be even more frank.

262
00:31:10,415 --> 00:31:15,375
To show you that I'm not a hard-hearted
man. That it's not all dollars and cents.

263
00:31:15,520 --> 00:31:19,081
She was beautiful.
She was young and innocent!

264
00:31:19,224 --> 00:31:24,491
She's the greatest piece of ass I've had
and I've had them all over the world.

265
00:31:24,629 --> 00:31:30,864
Then Johnny Fontane comes along with
his olive oil voice and Guinea charm.

266
00:31:31,002 --> 00:31:32,697
And she runs off.

267
00:31:34,005 --> 00:31:37,031
She threw it all away
just to make me look ridiculous!

268
00:31:38,210 --> 00:31:43,375
And a man in my position can't afford
to be made to look ridiculous!

269
00:31:43,515 --> 00:31:45,745
You get the hell out of here!

270
00:31:45,884 --> 00:31:50,253
If that goombah tries any rough stuff,
tell him I'm no bandleader.

271
00:31:51,489 --> 00:31:54,481
Yeah, I heard that story.

272
00:31:55,393 --> 00:31:59,261
Thank you for dinner
and a very pleasant evening.

273
00:31:59,397 --> 00:32:02,127
Maybe your car can take me
to the airport.

274
00:32:02,267 --> 00:32:06,033
Mr Corleone insists on hearing
bad news immediately.

275
00:33:58,650 --> 00:34:02,552
- You're not too tired, are you, Tom?
- No, I slept on the plane.

276
00:34:02,687 --> 00:34:05,656
I have the Sollozzo notes here.

277
00:34:05,790 --> 00:34:07,052
Now...

278
00:34:09,160 --> 00:34:14,154
Sollozzo is known as The Turk. He's
supposed to be very good with a knife,

279
00:34:14,833 --> 00:34:19,167
but only in matters of business
with reasonable complaint.

280
00:34:19,304 --> 00:34:22,273
His business is narcotics.

281
00:34:22,407 --> 00:34:25,843
He has fields in Turkey,
where they grow poppy.

282
00:34:25,977 --> 00:34:29,936
In Sicily he has plants to process them
into heroin.

283
00:34:30,081 --> 00:34:33,517
He needs cash, he needs protection
from the police.

284
00:34:33,651 --> 00:34:37,587
He'll give a piece of the action.
I don't know how much.

285
00:34:37,722 --> 00:34:42,921
The Tattaglia family is behind him here.
They have to be in it for something.

286
00:34:43,928 --> 00:34:48,695
- What about his prison record?
- One term in Italy, one here.

287
00:34:48,833 --> 00:34:51,301
He's known as a top narcotics man.

288
00:34:51,436 --> 00:34:56,874
- Santino, what do you think?
- A lot of money in that white powder.

289
00:34:58,710 --> 00:35:00,007
Tom?

290
00:35:00,145 --> 00:35:04,309
Yes. There's more money in narcotics
than anything else.

291
00:35:04,449 --> 00:35:09,148
If we don't get into it, somebody else
will, maybe the five families.

292
00:35:09,287 --> 00:35:13,656
With that money they can buy
more police and political power.

293
00:35:13,792 --> 00:35:15,885
Then they come after us.

294
00:35:16,027 --> 00:35:22,227
Now we have unions and gambling, and
that's great, but narcotics is the future.

295
00:35:22,367 --> 00:35:28,101
If we don't get a piece of that action,
we risk everything in ten years' time.

296
00:35:32,177 --> 00:35:35,237
So? What's your answer
going to be, Pop?

297
00:35:40,118 --> 00:35:42,450
Don Corleone.

298
00:35:43,955 --> 00:35:47,254
I need a man who has powerful friends.

299
00:35:47,392 --> 00:35:49,986
I need a million dollars in cash.

300
00:35:50,128 --> 00:35:55,964
I need those politicians that you carry
in your pocket, like nickels and dimes.

301
00:35:57,435 --> 00:36:01,462
- What is the interest for my family?
- 30 per cent.

302
00:36:01,606 --> 00:36:05,508
In the first year your end should be
three, four million dollars.

303
00:36:05,643 --> 00:36:07,770
And then it would go up.

304
00:36:08,780 --> 00:36:12,181
And what is the interest
for the Tattaglia family?

305
00:36:14,219 --> 00:36:16,244
My compliments.

306
00:36:19,657 --> 00:36:22,251
I'll take care of them, out of my share.

307
00:36:23,127 --> 00:36:27,393
So I receive 30 per cent for finance,

308
00:36:27,532 --> 00:36:30,933
political influence and legal protection?

309
00:36:31,069 --> 00:36:32,764
That's right.

310
00:36:33,905 --> 00:36:37,807
Why do you come to me?
Why do I deserve this generosity?

311
00:36:37,942 --> 00:36:43,141
If you consider a million dollars in cash
just finance,

312
00:36:43,281 --> 00:36:45,613
ti saluto, Don Corleone.

313
00:36:55,994 --> 00:37:01,125
I said that I would see you, because
I heard you were a serious man,

314
00:37:01,266 --> 00:37:03,564
to be treated with respect.

315
00:37:08,339 --> 00:37:11,638
But, I must say no to you.

316
00:37:12,710 --> 00:37:15,178
And I'll give you my reason.

317
00:37:15,647 --> 00:37:18,480
It's true, I have a lot of friends in politics.

318
00:37:19,751 --> 00:37:24,051
They wouldn't be friendly long if I was
involved in drugs instead of gambling,

319
00:37:24,188 --> 00:37:29,854
which they regard as a harmless vice,
but drugs is a dirty business.

320
00:37:29,994 --> 00:37:34,863
It doesn't make any difference to me
what a man does for a living.

321
00:37:34,999 --> 00:37:40,266
But your business is...
a little dangerous.

322
00:37:40,405 --> 00:37:44,466
If you're worried about security,
the Tattaglias will guarantee it.

323
00:37:44,876 --> 00:37:48,368
- The Tattaglias would guarantee our...
- Wait a minute.

324
00:37:55,653 --> 00:38:00,215
I have a sentimental weakness
for my children, and I spoil them.

325
00:38:00,358 --> 00:38:04,021
They talk when they should listen.
But anyway...

326
00:38:04,162 --> 00:38:09,429
Signor Sollozzo, my no is final. I wish to
congratulate you on your new business.

327
00:38:09,567 --> 00:38:12,866
I know you'll do well, and good luck.

328
00:38:13,004 --> 00:38:18,067
Especially since your interests
don't conflict with mine. Thank you.

329
00:38:38,529 --> 00:38:40,224
Santino.

330
00:38:40,365 --> 00:38:42,333
Come here.

331
00:38:44,569 --> 00:38:51,099
What's the matter with you? Your brain
is going soft from playing with that girl.

332
00:38:51,242 --> 00:38:55,645
Never tell anybody outside the family
what you're thinking again.

333
00:38:56,814 --> 00:38:58,076
Go on.

334
00:39:01,953 --> 00:39:04,615
Tom, what's this nonsense?

335
00:39:04,756 --> 00:39:08,522
It's from Johnny.
He's starring in that new film.

336
00:39:10,662 --> 00:39:13,392
- Take it away.
- Take it over there.

337
00:39:14,599 --> 00:39:16,123
And...

338
00:39:17,068 --> 00:39:19,536
...tell Luca Brasi to come in.

339
00:39:25,410 --> 00:39:28,743
I'm a little worried
about this Sollozzo fellow.

340
00:39:28,880 --> 00:39:31,610
Find out what he's got
under his fingernails.

341
00:39:32,917 --> 00:39:36,444
Go to the Tattaglias.

342
00:39:36,587 --> 00:39:42,048
Make them think that you're not
too happy with our family

343
00:39:42,193 --> 00:39:44,718
and find out what you can.

344
00:40:02,113 --> 00:40:05,344
I got something for your mother
and for Sonny

345
00:40:05,483 --> 00:40:10,352
and a tie for Freddy,
and Tom Hagen got the Reynolds pen.

346
00:40:10,488 --> 00:40:13,821
- What do you want for Christmas?
- Just you.

347
00:40:45,356 --> 00:40:47,221
Andiamo, Fredo.

348
00:40:47,358 --> 00:40:50,816
- Tell Paulie to get the car.
- Okay, Pop.

349
00:40:50,962 --> 00:40:54,830
I'll have to get it myself.
Paulie called in sick this morning.

350
00:40:56,667 --> 00:40:59,795
Paulie's a good kid.
I don't mind getting the car.

351
00:41:03,341 --> 00:41:05,332
Buon Natale, caro. Grazie.

352
00:41:48,119 --> 00:41:52,715
- Luca! I'm Bruno Tattaglia.
- I know.

353
00:42:02,500 --> 00:42:03,899
You know who I am?

354
00:42:04,035 --> 00:42:05,502
I know you.

355
00:42:05,636 --> 00:42:09,072
You have been talking to the
Tattaglia family... right?

356
00:42:10,541 --> 00:42:15,205
I think you and I can do business.

357
00:42:16,814 --> 00:42:19,305
I need someone strong like you.

358
00:42:19,450 --> 00:42:23,079
I heard you are not happy...

359
00:42:23,221 --> 00:42:25,485
...with the Corleone family.

360
00:42:25,623 --> 00:42:29,252
Want to join me?

361
00:42:29,393 --> 00:42:31,793
What's in it for me?

362
00:42:31,929 --> 00:42:35,660
$50,000 to start with.

363
00:42:39,170 --> 00:42:41,400
Not bad!

364
00:42:41,539 --> 00:42:44,303
Agreed?

365
00:43:42,500 --> 00:43:46,197
Tom! Tom Hagen. Merry Christmas.

366
00:43:46,337 --> 00:43:51,331
- Glad to see you. I want to talk to you.
- I haven't got time.

367
00:43:51,475 --> 00:43:54,501
Make time, Consigliere. Get in the car.

368
00:43:56,280 --> 00:44:00,944
What are you worried about? If I wanted
to kill you, you'd be dead already.

369
00:44:01,085 --> 00:44:02,450
Get in.

370
00:44:13,364 --> 00:44:17,061
- Fredo, I'm going to buy some fruit.
- Okay, Pop.

371
00:44:23,374 --> 00:44:26,832
Merry Christmas. I want some fruit.

372
00:45:54,265 --> 00:45:58,292
Would you like me better
if I were a nun? Like in the story.

373
00:46:01,338 --> 00:46:02,498
No.

374
00:46:02,640 --> 00:46:07,373
- What if I were Ingrid Bergman?
- Now, that's a thought.

375
00:46:09,480 --> 00:46:11,004
Michael.

376
00:46:11,148 --> 00:46:16,313
No, I wouldn't like you better if you were
Ingrid Bergman. What's the matter?

377
00:46:32,670 --> 00:46:35,468
They don't say if he's dead or alive.

378
00:46:57,461 --> 00:47:00,760
- Sonny, it's Michael.
- Where have you been?

379
00:47:00,898 --> 00:47:03,560
- Is he all right?
- We don't know yet.

380
00:47:03,701 --> 00:47:08,536
There are all kinds of stories.
He was hit bad, Mikey.

381
00:47:09,773 --> 00:47:12,799
- Are you there?
- Yeah, I'm here.

382
00:47:12,943 --> 00:47:17,403
- Where have you been? I was worried.
- Didn't Tom tell you I called?

383
00:47:17,548 --> 00:47:22,212
No. Look, come home, kid.
You should be with Mama, you hear?

384
00:47:29,627 --> 00:47:31,424
Oh, my God.

385
00:47:35,299 --> 00:47:36,823
Sonny!

386
00:47:45,776 --> 00:47:47,744
Stay back there.

387
00:47:47,878 --> 00:47:50,642
- Who is it?
- Open up, it's Clemenza.

388
00:47:53,017 --> 00:47:56,043
There's more news about your old man.

389
00:47:56,187 --> 00:47:58,849
Word is out that he's already dead.

390
00:47:58,989 --> 00:48:02,857
- What's the matter with you?
- Take it easy!

391
00:48:02,993 --> 00:48:06,190
- Where was Paulie?
- Sick. He's been sick all winter.

392
00:48:06,330 --> 00:48:09,265
- How often?
- Only three, four times.

393
00:48:09,400 --> 00:48:12,699
- Freddy didn't want a new bodyguard.
- Pick him up now.

394
00:48:12,836 --> 00:48:17,432
I don't care how sick he is. Bring him
to my father's house right now.

395
00:48:17,575 --> 00:48:20,908
- You want anyone sent over here?
- No. Go ahead.

396
00:48:30,020 --> 00:48:33,421
I'm going to have a couple of our people
come over to the house.

397
00:48:36,827 --> 00:48:38,954
- Hello?
- Santino Corleone?

398
00:48:39,096 --> 00:48:42,031
- Yeah.
- We have Tom Hagen.

399
00:48:42,166 --> 00:48:45,658
In three hours he'll be released
with our proposition.

400
00:48:45,803 --> 00:48:49,102
Listen to what he has to say
before you do anything.

401
00:48:49,240 --> 00:48:53,802
What's done is done. Don't lose that
famous temper of yours, Sonny.

402
00:48:53,944 --> 00:48:55,639
I'll wait.

403
00:49:09,960 --> 00:49:11,951
Your boss is dead.

404
00:49:14,798 --> 00:49:19,235
I know you're not in the muscle end
of the family, so don't be scared.

405
00:49:20,304 --> 00:49:24,707
I want you to help the Corleones
and me.

406
00:49:28,212 --> 00:49:32,706
We got him outside his office
about an hour after we picked you up.

407
00:49:34,251 --> 00:49:35,513
Drink it.

408
00:49:39,890 --> 00:49:43,348
It's up to you to make peace
between me and Sonny.

409
00:49:47,798 --> 00:49:50,562
Sonny was hot for my deal, wasn't he?

410
00:49:52,002 --> 00:49:54,835
And you knew
it was the right thing to do.

411
00:49:55,973 --> 00:50:01,411
- Sonny will come after you.
- That will be his first reaction, sure.

412
00:50:02,513 --> 00:50:08,281
So you have to talk sense into him.
The Tattaglia family is behind me.

413
00:50:09,119 --> 00:50:14,147
The other New York families will go
along with anything to prevent war.

414
00:50:14,291 --> 00:50:20,127
Let's face it, with all due respect,
the Don-rest in peace-was slipping.

415
00:50:22,499 --> 00:50:25,491
Ten years ago,
could I have gotten to him?

416
00:50:29,373 --> 00:50:33,867
Well, now he's dead, Tom,
and nothing can bring him back.

417
00:50:35,112 --> 00:50:41,517
You've got to talk to Sonny, to the
Caporegimes, Tessio, fat Clemenza.

418
00:50:45,956 --> 00:50:48,424
It's good business, Tom.

419
00:50:49,426 --> 00:50:54,693
I'll try. But even Sonny won't be able
to call off Luca Brasi.

420
00:50:57,301 --> 00:50:59,098
Yeah, well...

421
00:51:00,938 --> 00:51:03,270
Let me worry about Luca.

422
00:51:08,579 --> 00:51:10,444
You just talk to Sonny.

423
00:51:11,048 --> 00:51:13,278
And the other two kids.

424
00:51:16,153 --> 00:51:18,986
- I'll do my best.
- Good.

425
00:51:21,024 --> 00:51:24,152
Now you can go.

426
00:51:30,434 --> 00:51:35,167
I don't like violence, Tom.
I'm a businessman.

427
00:51:35,305 --> 00:51:37,773
Blood is a big expense.

428
00:51:58,829 --> 00:52:00,626
He's still alive.

429
00:52:00,764 --> 00:52:04,757
They hit him with five shots,
and he's still alive!

430
00:52:04,902 --> 00:52:09,896
That's bad luck for me, and bad luck
for you if you don't make that deal.

431
00:52:54,284 --> 00:52:58,618
Your mother is at the hospital with
your father. Looks like he'll pull through.

432
00:53:00,858 --> 00:53:07,320
It's a lot of bad blood. Sollozzo, Philip
Tattaglia, Bruno Tattaglia, Ramon...

433
00:53:07,464 --> 00:53:11,025
- You gonna kill all those guys?
- Stay out of it.

434
00:53:11,168 --> 00:53:13,568
If you get rid of Sollozzo,
everything falls into line.

435
00:53:13,704 --> 00:53:18,073
What about Luca?
Sollozzo thinks he can control him.

436
00:53:18,208 --> 00:53:21,666
If Luca sold out, we're in a lot of trouble.

437
00:53:21,812 --> 00:53:25,714
- Has anyone been in touch with Luca?
- We've been trying all night.

438
00:53:25,849 --> 00:53:30,115
- Hey, do me a favour...
- Luca never sleeps over with a broad.

439
00:53:31,788 --> 00:53:36,987
Well, Tom, you're consigliere.
What do we do if the old man dies?

440
00:53:38,095 --> 00:53:44,330
If we lose the old man, we lose the
political contacts and half our strength.

441
00:53:44,468 --> 00:53:49,770
The other New York families might
support Sollozzo to avoid a long war.

442
00:53:49,907 --> 00:53:54,537
This is almost 1 946.
Nobody wants bloodshed anymore.

443
00:53:54,678 --> 00:53:56,339
If your father dies...

444
00:53:58,882 --> 00:54:00,315
...you make the deal.

445
00:54:00,450 --> 00:54:05,251
- Easy to say. He's not your father.
- I'm as much a son as you or Mike.

446
00:54:10,160 --> 00:54:11,684
What is it?

447
00:54:12,696 --> 00:54:18,396
- Paulie, I told you to stay put.
- The guy at the gates has a package.

448
00:54:18,535 --> 00:54:21,095
Tessio, go see what it is.

449
00:54:23,974 --> 00:54:26,204
- Shall I stay?
- Yeah. Are you all right?

450
00:54:26,343 --> 00:54:30,040
- I'm fine.
- There's food. Are you hungry?

451
00:54:30,180 --> 00:54:33,707
- No.
- A drink? Brandy will sweat it out.

452
00:54:33,850 --> 00:54:36,410
- Go ahead.
- That might be a good idea.

453
00:54:37,921 --> 00:54:43,018
Take care of that son-of-a-bitch.
Paulie sold out the old man.

454
00:54:43,160 --> 00:54:47,563
- Make that the first thing on your list.
- Understood.

455
00:54:48,098 --> 00:54:52,125
Mickey, tomorrow, get some guys
and go to Luca's apartment.

456
00:54:52,269 --> 00:54:56,296
Maybe we shouldn't get Mike
mixed up in this too directly.

457
00:54:58,642 --> 00:55:02,169
Hanging around the house on
the phone would be a big help.

458
00:55:03,246 --> 00:55:05,146
Try Luca again.

459
00:55:14,124 --> 00:55:16,888
- What's this?
- A Sicilian message.

460
00:55:17,027 --> 00:55:19,518
It means Luca Brasi
sleeps with the fishes.

461
00:55:33,577 --> 00:55:35,670
- I'm going.
- When will you be home?

462
00:55:35,812 --> 00:55:37,473
Probably late.

463
00:55:39,983 --> 00:55:43,885
- Don't forget the cannoli!
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.

464
00:55:45,889 --> 00:55:50,383
Rocco, sit on the other side.
You block the rear-view mirror.

465
00:55:51,862 --> 00:55:55,320
Sonny's running wild. He wants
to go to mattresses already.

466
00:55:55,465 --> 00:56:01,267
We have to find a spot on the
West Side. Try 309 West 43rd Street.

467
00:56:01,405 --> 00:56:04,863
- Know a good spot on the West Side?
- I'll think about it.

468
00:56:05,008 --> 00:56:08,705
Think while you're driving.
I want to hit New York this month.

469
00:56:08,845 --> 00:56:10,574
Watch the kids.

470
00:56:21,425 --> 00:56:27,227
Paulie, go down 39th Street, pick up
1 8 mattresses and bring me the bill.

471
00:56:27,364 --> 00:56:28,695
Yeah, all right.

472
00:56:28,832 --> 00:56:33,269
Make sure they're clean, because
the guys will be there a long time.

473
00:56:33,403 --> 00:56:37,533
- They're clean and exterminated.
- That's a bad word to use.

474
00:56:37,674 --> 00:56:41,770
Exterminate! Watch out,
so we don't exterminate you!

475
00:56:48,552 --> 00:56:51,077
Pull over. I've got to take a leak.
