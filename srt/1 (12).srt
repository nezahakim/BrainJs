1
00:00:20,500 --> 00:00:23,800
Leave the gun. Take the cannoli.

2
00:00:41,900 --> 00:00:45,200
Hey, Mike! Hey, Mikey!

3
00:00:46,600 --> 00:00:48,500
- Yeah.
- Phone call!

4
00:00:54,800 --> 00:00:57,100
- Who is it?
- Some girl.

5
00:01:01,400 --> 00:01:03,900
- Hello. Kay?
- How's your father?

6
00:01:03,900 --> 00:01:05,700
He's going to make it.

7
00:01:06,400 --> 00:01:08,200
I love you.

8
00:01:09,500 --> 00:01:11,100
I love you!

9
00:01:12,100 --> 00:01:14,700
- Michael?
- Yeah, I know.

10
00:01:14,700 --> 00:01:17,700
- Tell me you love me.
- I can't talk.

11
00:01:17,700 --> 00:01:19,600
Can't you say it?

12
00:01:20,700 --> 00:01:22,600
I'll see you tonight.

13
00:01:23,400 --> 00:01:26,600
Why don't you tell that nice girl
you love her?

14
00:01:26,600 --> 00:01:31,400
I love you with all my heart. If I don't
see you again soon, I'm going to die!

15
00:01:32,500 --> 00:01:37,400
Come and learn something. You might
have to cook for 20 guys some day.

16
00:01:37,400 --> 00:01:41,200
You start with a little oil,
then fry some garlic.

17
00:01:41,200 --> 00:01:46,700
Throw in some tomatoes, tomato paste,
fry it and make sure it doesn't stick.

18
00:01:46,700 --> 00:01:50,700
You get it to a boil, you shove in
all your sausage and meatballs.

19
00:01:52,800 --> 00:01:54,900
Add a little bit of wine.

20
00:01:58,200 --> 00:02:02,700
And a little bit of sugar. That's my trick.

21
00:02:02,700 --> 00:02:07,100
Cut the crap. I have more important
things for you. How's Paulie?

22
00:02:07,100 --> 00:02:09,300
You won't see him no more.

23
00:02:10,800 --> 00:02:13,300
- Where are you going?
- To the city.

24
00:02:13,300 --> 00:02:16,900
- Send bodyguards with him.
- I'm going to the hospital...

25
00:02:16,900 --> 00:02:20,400
He'll be all right. Sollozzo knows
he's a civilian.

26
00:02:20,400 --> 00:02:22,500
- Be careful.
- Yes, sir.

27
00:02:25,500 --> 00:02:27,700
Send somebody with him anyway.

28
00:02:56,200 --> 00:02:59,600
- I have to go.
- Can I go with you?

29
00:03:00,800 --> 00:03:05,500
No, Kay. There will be detectives there,
people from the press.

30
00:03:05,500 --> 00:03:07,800
I'll wait in the cab.

31
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:12,600
I don't want you to get involved.

32
00:03:15,300 --> 00:03:17,800
When will I see you again?

33
00:03:23,800 --> 00:03:27,800
Go back to New Hampshire, and I'll
call you at your parents' house.

34
00:03:29,700 --> 00:03:34,600
- When will I see you again, Michael?
- I don't know.

35
00:05:46,600 --> 00:05:50,600
What are you doing here?
You're not supposed to be here.

36
00:05:50,600 --> 00:05:54,200
I'm Michael Corleone. This is my father.

37
00:05:54,200 --> 00:05:56,900
What happened to the guards?

38
00:05:56,900 --> 00:06:02,100
Your father had too many visitors.
They interfered with hospital service.

39
00:06:02,100 --> 00:06:05,500
The police made them leave
about ten minutes ago.

40
00:06:09,900 --> 00:06:13,800
Get me Long Beach 45620, please.

41
00:06:16,500 --> 00:06:19,300
Nurse. Wait a minute. Stay here.

42
00:06:22,800 --> 00:06:27,800
Sonny, I'm at the hospital.
I got here late, there's nobody here.

43
00:06:27,800 --> 00:06:31,800
No Tessio's men, no detectives,
nobody. Papa's all alone.

44
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:34,700
- Don't panic.
- I won't panic.

45
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:39,000
I'm sorry, but you will have to leave.

46
00:06:41,800 --> 00:06:47,700
We're going to move him to another
room. Can you disconnect the tubes?

47
00:06:47,700 --> 00:06:51,300
- That's out of the question!
- Do you know my father?

48
00:06:51,300 --> 00:06:55,300
Men are coming here to kill him.
Do you understand?

49
00:06:55,700 --> 00:06:57,700
Help me, please.

50
00:08:14,500 --> 00:08:18,300
- Who are you?
- I am Enzo, the baker.

51
00:08:19,400 --> 00:08:21,600
- Remember me?
- Enzo.

52
00:08:21,600 --> 00:08:24,700
You'd better go,
there's going to be trouble.

53
00:08:24,700 --> 00:08:29,300
If there is trouble, I'll stay here to
help you. For your father.

54
00:08:31,400 --> 00:08:35,400
Listen. Wait for me outside,
in front of the hospital, all right?

55
00:08:35,600 --> 00:08:37,600
I'll be out in a minute.

56
00:08:51,500 --> 00:08:55,500
Just lie here, Pop.
I'll take care of you now.

57
00:08:57,200 --> 00:08:59,200
I'm with you now.

58
00:09:00,800 --> 00:09:02,300
I'm with you.

59
00:09:37,900 --> 00:09:40,000
Get rid of these. Come here.

60
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:45,000
Put your hand in your pocket, like you
have a gun. You'll be all right.

61
00:10:36,800 --> 00:10:38,800
You did good.

62
00:11:26,900 --> 00:11:30,300
I thought all you Guinea hoods
were locked up!

63
00:11:30,300 --> 00:11:34,800
- Why isn't anyone guarding my father?
- You little punk!

64
00:11:34,800 --> 00:11:38,800
Don't you tell me my business!
I pulled them off.

65
00:11:38,900 --> 00:11:44,900
- Stay away from this hospital!
- Not until my father's room is guarded.

66
00:11:45,600 --> 00:11:49,100
- Phil, take him in!
- The kid's clean, Captain.

67
00:11:49,100 --> 00:11:53,100
- He's a war hero. He's never been...
- I said take him in!

68
00:11:55,100 --> 00:12:00,900
- What's The Turk paying you?
- Take a hold of him. Stand him up.

69
00:12:01,400 --> 00:12:03,000
Stand him up straight.

70
00:12:25,300 --> 00:12:31,100
I'm the Corleone's attorney. These men
are hired to protect Vito Corleone.

71
00:12:31,100 --> 00:12:33,500
They're licensed to carry firearms.

72
00:12:33,500 --> 00:12:38,200
If you interfere, you'll have to appear
before the judge and show cause.

73
00:12:38,200 --> 00:12:40,400
Let him go.

74
00:13:12,800 --> 00:13:16,500
- What's with all the new faces?
- We'll need them now.

75
00:13:16,500 --> 00:13:19,200
After the hospital thing, Sonny got mad.

76
00:13:19,200 --> 00:13:22,300
We hit Bruno Tattaglia this morning.

77
00:13:23,700 --> 00:13:25,700
Jesus Christ.

78
00:13:32,500 --> 00:13:35,200
Looks like a fortress around here.

79
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:42,600
Tommasuccio! Hey... 100 buttonmen
on the street 24 hours a day.

80
00:13:42,600 --> 00:13:46,200
That Turk shows one hair on his ass,
he's dead.

81
00:13:48,200 --> 00:13:50,200
Mike, let me look at you.

82
00:13:54,300 --> 00:13:57,500
You're beautiful, beautiful.
You're gorgeous.

83
00:13:57,500 --> 00:14:03,300
The Turk wants to talk! Imagine
the nerve of the son-of-a-bitch.

84
00:14:03,300 --> 00:14:06,100
- He wants a meeting today.
- What did he say?

85
00:14:06,100 --> 00:14:10,900
What did he say... He wants us to send
Michael to hear the proposition.

86
00:14:10,900 --> 00:14:14,500
He promises that the deal
is too good to refuse.

87
00:14:14,500 --> 00:14:17,700
- And Bruno Tattaglia?
- That's part of the deal.

88
00:14:17,700 --> 00:14:21,700
- He cancels out what they did to Father.
- We should listen to them.

89
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:25,200
No more! Not this time, Consigliere.

90
00:14:25,200 --> 00:14:28,900
No more meetings, discussions,
or Sollozzo tricks.

91
00:14:28,900 --> 00:14:31,800
I want Sollozzo, or we go to war...

92
00:14:31,800 --> 00:14:35,000
- The other families...
- They hand me Sollozzo!

93
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:37,800
This is business, not personal!

94
00:14:37,800 --> 00:14:42,800
- They shot my father...
- Even that was business, not personal.

95
00:14:42,800 --> 00:14:46,600
Then business will have to suffer.
Do me a favour.

96
00:14:46,600 --> 00:14:50,600
No more advice on how to
patch things up. Just help me win.

97
00:14:57,000 --> 00:15:00,900
I found out about Captain McCluskey,
who broke Mike's jaw.

98
00:15:00,900 --> 00:15:04,900
He's definitely on Sollozzo's payroll,
and for big money.

99
00:15:05,300 --> 00:15:09,300
McCluskey has agreed to be
The Turk's bodyguard.

100
00:15:09,400 --> 00:15:13,400
So when Sollozzo is being guarded,
he's invulnerable.

101
00:15:13,400 --> 00:15:17,000
Nobody has ever gunned down
a New York police captain.

102
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:23,000
All the families would come after you.
The Corleone family would be outcasts!

103
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:26,700
Even the old man's political protection
would run for cover.

104
00:15:28,100 --> 00:15:32,100
Do me a favour.
Take this into consideration.

105
00:15:35,700 --> 00:15:37,900
All right, we'll wait.

106
00:15:43,100 --> 00:15:46,100
We can't wait. We can't wait.

107
00:15:47,400 --> 00:15:51,400
No matter what Sollozzo says,
he's going to kill Pop.

108
00:15:51,400 --> 00:15:55,300
That's the key for him.
We've got to get Sollozzo.

109
00:15:55,300 --> 00:15:59,800
- Mike is right.
- Let me ask you something.

110
00:15:59,800 --> 00:16:04,400
What about this McCluskey?
What do we do with this cop?

111
00:16:09,500 --> 00:16:12,200
They want to have a meeting
with me, right?

112
00:16:13,300 --> 00:16:17,900
It will be me, McCluskey and Sollozzo.

113
00:16:19,600 --> 00:16:21,800
Let's set the meeting.

114
00:16:23,800 --> 00:16:27,800
Get our informers to find out
where it's going to be held.

115
00:16:29,400 --> 00:16:33,100
We insist it's a public place.
A bar, a restaurant.

116
00:16:33,100 --> 00:16:37,100
Some place where there are people,
so I feel safe.

117
00:16:39,700 --> 00:16:42,700
They'll search me when I meet them,
right?

118
00:16:42,700 --> 00:16:45,000
So I can't have a weapon on me.

119
00:16:48,600 --> 00:16:54,200
But if Clemenza can figure out a way to
have a weapon planted there for me...

120
00:16:58,500 --> 00:17:01,200
...then I'll kill them both.

121
00:17:12,700 --> 00:17:17,600
Nice college boy. Didn't want to
get mixed up in the family business.

122
00:17:17,600 --> 00:17:21,300
Now you want to shoot a police captain
because he slapped you?

123
00:17:21,300 --> 00:17:28,000
This isn't like the army! You have to get
close and get their brains on your suit.

124
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:31,100
You're taking this very personal.

125
00:17:31,100 --> 00:17:34,700
Tom, this is business
and he's taking it personal.

126
00:17:34,700 --> 00:17:38,500
- Where does it say you can't kill a cop?
- Mikey...

127
00:17:38,500 --> 00:17:45,300
I'm talking about a cop who's mixed up
in drugs, a dishonest cop.

128
00:17:45,300 --> 00:17:49,200
A cop who got mixed up in the rackets
and got what was coming.

129
00:17:49,800 --> 00:17:54,500
That's a terrific story. We have
newspaper people on the payroll, right?

130
00:17:55,700 --> 00:17:59,700
- They might like a story like that.
- They might.

131
00:18:03,300 --> 00:18:06,800
It's not personal, Sonny.
It's strictly business.

132
00:18:09,900 --> 00:18:15,300
It's as cold as they come. Impossible to
trace, so you don't worry about prints.

133
00:18:15,300 --> 00:18:19,600
I put a special tape on the trigger
and the butt. Try it.

134
00:18:31,600 --> 00:18:33,700
Is the trigger too tight?

135
00:18:37,100 --> 00:18:38,400
My ears!

136
00:18:38,400 --> 00:18:44,200
I left it noisy, so it scares away any
pain-in-the-ass innocent bystanders.

137
00:18:44,200 --> 00:18:46,800
You've shot them both.
Now what do you do?

138
00:18:49,000 --> 00:18:53,000
- Sit down, finish my dinner.
- Don't fool around.

139
00:18:53,100 --> 00:18:56,800
Let your hand drop to your side
and let the gun slip out.

140
00:18:56,800 --> 00:19:00,800
Everybody will still think you've got it.
They'll stare at your face,

141
00:19:01,200 --> 00:19:04,300
so walk out fast, but don't run.

142
00:19:04,300 --> 00:19:07,800
Don't look anybody in the eye,
but don't look away either.

143
00:19:07,800 --> 00:19:11,100
They'll be scared stiff,
so don't worry about nothing.

144
00:19:13,400 --> 00:19:17,400
You'll be all right. You'll take a vacation,
nobody knows where,

145
00:19:17,700 --> 00:19:19,400
and we'll catch the hell.

146
00:19:20,400 --> 00:19:24,200
- How bad do you think it will be?
- Pretty goddamn bad.

147
00:19:24,200 --> 00:19:27,400
All the other families will probably
line up against us.

148
00:19:27,400 --> 00:19:33,100
These things have to happen every five,
ten years. Gets rid of the bad blood.

149
00:19:33,100 --> 00:19:37,700
Been ten years since the last one.
You have to stop them at the beginning.

150
00:19:37,700 --> 00:19:43,700
Like they should have stopped Hitler in
Munich, not letting him get away with it.

151
00:19:44,800 --> 00:19:49,300
You know, Mike, we were all proud
of you. Being a hero and all.

152
00:19:49,300 --> 00:19:51,200
Your father too.

153
00:20:29,100 --> 00:20:32,600
Nothing. Not a hint. Absolutely nothing.

154
00:20:33,600 --> 00:20:37,600
Even Sollozzo's people don't know
where the meeting will be held.

155
00:20:37,900 --> 00:20:40,900
How much time do we have?

156
00:20:40,900 --> 00:20:45,700
They're going to pick you up outside
Jack Dempsey's in an hour and a half.

157
00:20:47,000 --> 00:20:52,000
- We could put a tail on them.
- Sollozzo would lose our ass.

158
00:20:53,200 --> 00:20:57,900
- What about the negotiator?
- He's playing pinochle with my men.

159
00:20:57,900 --> 00:21:03,000
- He's happy. They're letting him win.
- Too risky. Maybe we should call it off.

160
00:21:03,000 --> 00:21:06,600
The negotiator plays cards
until Mike is back safe.

161
00:21:06,600 --> 00:21:10,500
- He could blast whoever is in the car.
- They'll expect that.

162
00:21:10,500 --> 00:21:14,000
Sollozzo might not even be
in the car, Sonny!

163
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:15,300
I'll get it.

164
00:21:40,800 --> 00:21:43,200
Louis' restaurant in the Bronx.

165
00:21:43,200 --> 00:21:46,100
- Is it reliable?
- My man in McCluskey's precinct.

166
00:21:46,100 --> 00:21:52,200
A police captain is on call 24 hours
a day. He'll be there between 8 and 10.

167
00:21:52,200 --> 00:21:57,100
- Anybody know this joint?
- Sure, I do. It's perfect for us.

168
00:21:57,100 --> 00:22:02,200
A small family place, good food.
Everyone minds his business. Perfect.

169
00:22:03,000 --> 00:22:08,400
They've got an old-fashioned toilet.
You know, the box and the chain thing.

170
00:22:10,100 --> 00:22:12,600
We might be able to tape the gun
behind it.

171
00:22:13,300 --> 00:22:17,300
All right. Mike, you go to the restaurant,

172
00:22:17,500 --> 00:22:21,500
you eat, talk for a while, you relax.
Make them relax.

173
00:22:21,600 --> 00:22:26,900
Then you go to take a leak. No, better
still, you ask permission to go.

174
00:22:26,900 --> 00:22:31,500
Then you come back blasting.
Two shots in the head a piece.

175
00:22:33,100 --> 00:22:35,800
I want somebody very good
to plant that gun.

176
00:22:35,800 --> 00:22:38,700
I don't want him coming out
with just his dick.

177
00:22:39,200 --> 00:22:45,000
- The gun will be there.
- You drive him and pick him up.

178
00:22:45,000 --> 00:22:47,400
Let's move.

179
00:22:52,200 --> 00:22:55,400
Did he tell you to drop the gun
right away?

180
00:22:55,400 --> 00:22:57,300
Yeah, a million times.

181
00:23:02,000 --> 00:23:06,600
Don't forget. Two shots a piece in
the head as soon as you come out.

182
00:23:12,800 --> 00:23:16,000
How long do you think it will be
before I can come back?

183
00:23:17,300 --> 00:23:19,500
At least a year.

184
00:23:19,500 --> 00:23:24,600
I'll square it with Mom, that you're not
seeing her before you leave and...

185
00:23:25,800 --> 00:23:29,200
I'll get a message to that girlfriend
when the time is right.

186
00:23:35,400 --> 00:23:37,200
Take care.

187
00:23:40,100 --> 00:23:41,800
Take care, Mike.

188
00:24:14,300 --> 00:24:18,100
I'm glad you came. I hope we can
straighten everything out.

189
00:24:19,400 --> 00:24:24,500
It's not the way I wanted things to go.
It should never have happened.

190
00:24:24,500 --> 00:24:28,900
I want to straighten everything out.
I don't want my father bothered again.

191
00:24:28,900 --> 00:24:32,200
I swear on my children
that he won't be, Mike.

192
00:24:33,200 --> 00:24:36,500
But you have to keep an open mind
when we talk.

193
00:24:36,500 --> 00:24:42,300
I hope you're not a hothead like Sonny.
You can't talk business with him.

194
00:24:42,300 --> 00:24:44,500
He's a good kid.

195
00:24:48,500 --> 00:24:52,200
I'm sorry about the other night, Mike.

196
00:24:52,200 --> 00:24:56,600
I've got to frisk you, so turn around.
On your knees, facing me.

197
00:25:01,200 --> 00:25:05,900
I guess I'm getting too old for my job.
Too grouchy.

198
00:25:07,200 --> 00:25:11,100
Can't stand the aggravation.
You know how it is.

199
00:25:13,400 --> 00:25:14,500
He's clean.

200
00:25:41,600 --> 00:25:43,800
Going to Jersey?

201
00:25:46,300 --> 00:25:47,900
Maybe.

202
00:26:13,200 --> 00:26:15,200
Nice work, Lou.

203
00:26:51,900 --> 00:26:57,700
- How's the food in this restaurant?
- Try the veal. It's the best in the city.

204
00:26:57,700 --> 00:26:59,400
I'll have it.

205
00:27:34,900 --> 00:27:38,200
- I'm going to speak Italian to Mikey.
- Go ahead.

206
00:28:57,600 --> 00:28:59,300
What I want...

207
00:29:00,500 --> 00:29:03,000
What's most important to me...

208
00:29:05,200 --> 00:29:09,600
...is that I have a guarantee.
No more attempts on my father's life.

209
00:29:09,600 --> 00:29:13,600
What guarantees can I give you?
I'm the hunted one!

210
00:29:14,400 --> 00:29:17,500
I missed my chance.
You think too much of me, kid.

211
00:29:18,000 --> 00:29:19,800
I'm not that clever.

212
00:29:21,400 --> 00:29:23,600
All I want is a truce.

213
00:29:30,300 --> 00:29:33,900
I have to go to the bathroom.
Is it all right?

214
00:29:35,500 --> 00:29:36,900
When you got to go, you got to go.

215
00:29:43,400 --> 00:29:44,900
He's clean.

216
00:29:45,500 --> 00:29:47,600
Don't take too long.

217
00:29:50,900 --> 00:29:52,500
I've frisked a thousand punks.

218
00:34:43,300 --> 00:34:45,200
Okay, you take over.

219
00:35:02,500 --> 00:35:04,600
I love you, Grandpa.

220
00:35:07,000 --> 00:35:10,000
I'm sorry, Pa. He doesn't know you yet.

221
00:35:11,100 --> 00:35:14,400
- Hey, big guy. Give it to Grandpa.
- Okay.

222
00:35:14,400 --> 00:35:20,700
"I hope you get well, Grandpa, and wish
I see you soon. Your grandson Frank."

223
00:35:23,800 --> 00:35:26,000
Go with your mother.

224
00:35:26,000 --> 00:35:28,100
Take them downstairs.

225
00:35:34,100 --> 00:35:36,600
Go on, Carlo, you too.

226
00:35:38,000 --> 00:35:39,700
Go on.

227
00:36:00,300 --> 00:36:04,300
- What's the matter with you, Carlo?
- Shut up and set the table.

228
00:36:20,000 --> 00:36:26,100
Since McCluskey's killing, the police
have cracked down on our operations.

229
00:36:27,800 --> 00:36:32,700
And also the other families.
There's been a lot of bad blood.

230
00:36:32,700 --> 00:36:36,200
They hit us, so we hit them back.

231
00:36:37,100 --> 00:36:41,700
Through our newspaper contacts
we've been able to put out material

232
00:36:41,700 --> 00:36:45,700
about McCluskey's link with Sollozzo
in the drug rackets.

233
00:36:46,100 --> 00:36:48,100
So things are loosening up.

234
00:36:49,400 --> 00:36:56,900
And I sent Fredo to Las Vegas, under
the protection of Don Francesco of L.A.

235
00:36:56,900 --> 00:37:02,000
- I want him to rest.
- I'm going to learn the casino business.

236
00:37:09,700 --> 00:37:11,700
Where's Michael?

237
00:37:23,800 --> 00:37:27,100
It was Michael who killed Sollozzo.

238
00:37:28,800 --> 00:37:32,800
But he's safe. We're starting to work
to bring him back.

239
00:37:54,300 --> 00:37:59,000
Did you find out where that old pimp
Tattaglia is hiding? I want him now.

240
00:37:59,000 --> 00:38:02,200
Sonny, things are starting to loosen up.

241
00:38:02,200 --> 00:38:07,000
If you go after Tattaglia, all hell
will break loose. Pop can negotiate.

242
00:38:07,000 --> 00:38:13,200
- He must get better first. I'll decide...
- War is costly. We can't do business.

243
00:38:13,200 --> 00:38:17,100
- Neither can they. Don't worry about it!
- We can't afford a stalemate.

244
00:38:17,100 --> 00:38:22,300
- No more stalemate. I'll kill the bastard!
- You're getting a great reputation!

245
00:38:22,300 --> 00:38:28,300
Do as I say! If I had a Sicilian wartime
consigliere, I wouldn't be in this shape!

246
00:38:28,300 --> 00:38:30,600
Pop had Genco. Look what I got.

247
00:38:34,000 --> 00:38:36,300
I'm sorry. I didn't mean that.

248
00:38:37,600 --> 00:38:40,600
Ma made a little dinner. It's Sunday.

249
00:38:41,400 --> 00:38:46,000
Niggers are having a good time
with our policy banks in Harlem.

250
00:38:46,000 --> 00:38:50,000
Driving new Cadillacs,
paying 50 percent on a bet.

251
00:38:50,100 --> 00:38:53,600
That's because they've started
making big money.

252
00:38:53,600 --> 00:38:57,100
Poppa never talked business
at the table.

253
00:38:57,100 --> 00:39:00,900
- Shut up, Connie...
- Don't you ever tell her to shut up.

254
00:39:01,900 --> 00:39:03,600
Don't interfere.

255
00:39:04,900 --> 00:39:09,200
I'd like to talk to you after dinner.
I could do more for the family...

256
00:39:09,200 --> 00:39:11,800
We don't discuss business at the table.

257
00:39:59,100 --> 00:40:01,500
I kiss your hand, Don Tommasino.

258
00:40:07,400 --> 00:40:09,400
Why are you so far
from the house?

259
00:40:10,100 --> 00:40:12,500
You know I'm responsible to your
father for your life.

260
00:40:12,500 --> 00:40:14,700
The bodyguards are here.

261
00:40:14,700 --> 00:40:17,300
It's still dangerous...

262
00:40:17,300 --> 00:40:20,200
We've heard from Santino
in New York...

263
00:40:20,200 --> 00:40:23,700
Your enemies know you're here.

264
00:40:23,700 --> 00:40:27,100
Did Santino say when
I can go back?

265
00:40:27,100 --> 00:40:29,000
Not yet.

266
00:40:29,000 --> 00:40:31,800
It's out of the question.

267
00:40:34,700 --> 00:40:37,500
Where are you going now?

268
00:40:38,900 --> 00:40:41,700
Take my car.

269
00:40:43,300 --> 00:40:45,600
I want to walk.

270
00:40:47,700 --> 00:40:49,500
Be careful.

271
00:41:22,900 --> 00:41:24,800
Where have all the men gone?

272
00:41:24,800 --> 00:41:27,500
They're all dead from vendettas.

273
00:41:30,000 --> 00:41:32,800
There are the names of the dead.

274
00:41:48,200 --> 00:41:52,200
Hey, hey, take me to the America, G.I.!

275
00:41:52,200 --> 00:41:56,700
Hey, hey, take me to the America, G.I.!
Clark Gable!

276
00:41:56,700 --> 00:42:02,200
America! Take me to the America, G.I.!
Clark Gable, Rita Hayworth!

277
00:42:19,900 --> 00:42:21,900
Mamma mia what a beauty.

278
00:42:31,100 --> 00:42:33,500
I think you got hit
by the thunderbolt.

279
00:42:38,600 --> 00:42:43,800
In Sicily women are more
dangerous than shotguns.

280
00:43:07,100 --> 00:43:09,200
Did you have a good hunt?

281
00:43:09,200 --> 00:43:12,000
You know all the girls
around here?

282
00:43:12,000 --> 00:43:14,600
We saw some real beauties.

283
00:43:14,600 --> 00:43:19,000
One of them struck our friend
like a thunderbolt.

284
00:43:21,300 --> 00:43:25,300
She would tempt the devil himself.

285
00:43:30,900 --> 00:43:34,400
Really put together.

286
00:43:37,700 --> 00:43:40,900
Such hair, such mouth!

287
00:43:42,900 --> 00:43:46,700
The girls around here are
beautiful...but virtuous.

288
00:43:46,700 --> 00:43:49,400
This one had a purple dress...

289
00:43:49,400 --> 00:43:52,200
And a purple ribbon in her hair.

290
00:43:52,200 --> 00:43:56,200
A type more Greek than Italian.

291
00:43:58,000 --> 00:44:00,700
Do you know her?

292
00:44:04,200 --> 00:44:07,600
There's no girl like that
in this town.

293
00:44:09,600 --> 00:44:12,300
My God, I understand!

294
00:44:15,600 --> 00:44:17,700
What's wrong?

295
00:44:19,200 --> 00:44:21,100
Let's go.

296
00:44:22,000 --> 00:44:23,500
It's his daughter.

297
00:44:23,500 --> 00:44:25,900
Tell him to come here.

298
00:44:28,200 --> 00:44:29,700
Call him.

299
00:44:49,800 --> 00:44:52,400
Fabrizio, you translate.

300
00:44:56,100 --> 00:44:59,200
I apologise if I offended you.

301
00:44:59,200 --> 00:45:02,500
I'm a stranger in this country.

302
00:45:02,500 --> 00:45:05,900
I meant no disrespect
to you or your daughter.

303
00:45:11,100 --> 00:45:14,300
I'm an American, hiding in Sicily.

304
00:45:15,300 --> 00:45:17,600
My name is Michael Corleone.

305
00:45:19,600 --> 00:45:23,600
There are people who'd pay a lot
of money for that information.

306
00:45:26,000 --> 00:45:29,000
But then your daughter
would lose a father...

307
00:45:30,500 --> 00:45:33,400
...instead of gaining a husband.

308
00:45:41,200 --> 00:45:44,100
I want to meet your daughter.

309
00:45:44,100 --> 00:45:48,600
With your permission, and under
the supervision of your family.

310
00:45:49,300 --> 00:45:51,400
With all respect.

311
00:45:57,300 --> 00:46:02,900
Come to my house Sunday morning.
My name is Vitelli.

312
00:46:07,400 --> 00:46:10,600
What's her name?

313
00:49:03,500 --> 00:49:05,700
I'll knock you dizzy.

314
00:49:11,400 --> 00:49:13,500
Save it for the library.

315
00:49:17,000 --> 00:49:19,600
We've got to pick up my sister.

316
00:49:37,800 --> 00:49:39,400
What's the matter?

317
00:49:42,000 --> 00:49:43,800
What's the matter?

318
00:49:45,600 --> 00:49:48,000
- It was my fault!
- Where is he?

319
00:49:48,000 --> 00:49:51,000
It was my fault. I hit him.

320
00:49:51,000 --> 00:49:54,800
I started a fight with him.
I hit him, so he hit me...

321
00:49:59,000 --> 00:50:03,000
I'm just going to get a doctor
to take a look at you.

322
00:50:03,100 --> 00:50:06,100
Sonny, please don't do anything.

323
00:50:07,700 --> 00:50:09,800
What's the matter with you?
What am I going to do?

324
00:50:09,800 --> 00:50:12,700
Make that baby an orphan
before he's born?

325
00:50:17,300 --> 00:50:20,100
You spic slobs still betting Yankees?

326
00:50:20,700 --> 00:50:24,100
Tell them to stop taking in action.

327
00:50:24,100 --> 00:50:25,900
We lost enough money last week.

328
00:50:33,000 --> 00:50:34,600
Come here, come here!

329
00:51:31,900 --> 00:51:35,300
If you touch my sister again, I'll kill you.

330
00:55:28,500 --> 00:55:32,500
Hey! We weren't expecting you, Kay.
You should call.

331
00:55:32,800 --> 00:55:37,300
Yes, I have. I've tried writing and calling.

332
00:55:37,300 --> 00:55:41,200
- I want to reach Michael.
- Nobody knows where he is.

333
00:55:41,200 --> 00:55:43,700
All we know is that he's all right.

334
00:55:46,300 --> 00:55:50,000
- What was that?
- An accident, but nobody was hurt.

335
00:55:51,000 --> 00:55:56,500
Tom, will you give this letter to Michael.
Please?

336
00:55:56,500 --> 00:56:02,500
If I accepted that, a court could prove
I have knowledge of his whereabouts.

337
00:56:02,500 --> 00:56:04,700
He'll get in touch with you.

338
00:56:04,700 --> 00:56:08,600
I let my cab go, so can I call
another one, please?

339
00:56:08,600 --> 00:56:10,500
Come on. Sorry.

340
00:56:27,500 --> 00:56:33,200
- Hello?
- Is Carlo there?

341
00:56:33,200 --> 00:56:35,700
- Who is this?
- A friend of Carlo.

342
00:56:35,700 --> 00:56:39,400
Tell him that I can't make it tonight
until later.

343
00:56:44,900 --> 00:56:46,200
Bitch!

344
00:56:48,300 --> 00:56:50,900
- Dinner's on the table.
- I'm not hungry.

345
00:56:50,900 --> 00:56:54,300
- The food is getting cold.
- I'll eat out later.

346
00:56:54,300 --> 00:56:57,400
You just told me to make you dinner!

347
00:57:05,100 --> 00:57:07,900
She has a filthy mouth, this Guinea brat.

348
00:57:12,200 --> 00:57:16,600
That's it, break it all, you spoiled
Guinea brat. Break it all!

349
00:57:25,800 --> 00:57:29,800
Why don't you bring your whore
home for dinner?

350
00:57:30,200 --> 00:57:31,800
Maybe I will.

351
00:57:38,200 --> 00:57:41,500
- Clean it up!
- Like hell I will!

352
00:57:41,500 --> 00:57:45,500
You skinny, spoiled brat.
Clean it up! Clean it up!

353
00:57:45,800 --> 00:57:49,600
Clean it up! I said, clean it up!
Clean it up!

354
00:57:52,400 --> 00:57:55,300
Clean it up. Clean that up, you...

355
00:57:58,200 --> 00:57:59,900
Clean it!

356
00:57:59,900 --> 00:58:04,400
Clean it up! Yeah, kill me.
Be a murderer, like your father!

357
00:58:04,400 --> 00:58:06,600
- All you Corleones are murderers!
- I hate you!

358
00:58:06,600 --> 00:58:09,400
Come on, kill me!

359
00:58:11,100 --> 00:58:15,100
Get out of here!
