1
00:00:00,200 --> 00:00:03,700
- I hate you!
- Now I'll kill you.

2
00:00:03,700 --> 00:00:07,000
You Guinea brat. Get out of here!

3
00:00:16,900 --> 00:00:20,100
Connie, what's the matter?
I can't hear you.

4
00:00:21,100 --> 00:00:24,100
Connie, talk louder. The baby's crying.

5
00:00:24,100 --> 00:00:27,100
Santino, I can't understand.
I don't know.

6
00:00:28,300 --> 00:00:30,100
Yeah, Connie.

7
00:00:35,200 --> 00:00:37,600
You wait there.

8
00:00:39,500 --> 00:00:42,400
No, you just wait there.

9
00:00:44,200 --> 00:00:46,900
Son-of-a-bitch.

10
00:00:46,900 --> 00:00:50,300
- Son-of-a-bitch!
- What's the matter?

11
00:00:53,700 --> 00:00:57,000
Open the goddamn gate!
Get off your ass.

12
00:01:04,900 --> 00:01:06,000
Sonny!

13
00:01:12,900 --> 00:01:15,800
- Sonny.
- Get out of here!

14
00:01:15,800 --> 00:01:17,800
Go after him, go on!

15
00:01:47,300 --> 00:01:49,600
Son-of-a-bitch. Come on!

16
00:03:38,200 --> 00:03:40,400
Give me a drop.

17
00:03:48,300 --> 00:03:50,800
My wife is crying upstairs.

18
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:55,700
I hear cars coming to the house.

19
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:03,300
Consigliere of mine,

20
00:04:03,300 --> 00:04:06,700
tell your Don what everyone
seems to know.

21
00:04:06,700 --> 00:04:09,000
I didn't tell Mama anything.

22
00:04:10,100 --> 00:04:13,900
I was about to come up and wake you
and tell you.

23
00:04:16,800 --> 00:04:18,900
But you needed a drink first.

24
00:04:21,700 --> 00:04:22,900
Yeah.

25
00:04:25,900 --> 00:04:28,300
Well, now you've had your drink.

26
00:04:33,900 --> 00:04:38,300
They shot Sonny on the causeway.
He's dead.

27
00:04:55,400 --> 00:04:58,400
I want no inquiries made.

28
00:05:02,100 --> 00:05:04,600
I want no acts of vengeance.

29
00:05:06,100 --> 00:05:08,900
I want you to arrange a meeting...

30
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:13,000
...with the heads of the five families.

31
00:05:14,600 --> 00:05:17,000
This war stops now.

32
00:05:38,600 --> 00:05:41,200
Call Bonasera.

33
00:05:41,200 --> 00:05:43,400
I need him now.

34
00:05:55,600 --> 00:06:00,800
This is Tom Hagen. I'm calling for
Vito Corleone, at his request.

35
00:06:00,800 --> 00:06:03,300
You owe your Don a service.

36
00:06:03,300 --> 00:06:07,100
He has no doubt that you will repay it.

37
00:06:07,100 --> 00:06:11,600
He will be at your funeral parlour
in one hour. Be there to greet him.

38
00:06:32,500 --> 00:06:37,500
Well, my friend, are you ready
to do me this service?

39
00:06:37,500 --> 00:06:40,900
Yes. What do you want me to do?

40
00:06:48,900 --> 00:06:53,800
I want you to use all your powers
and all your skills.

41
00:06:57,600 --> 00:07:00,700
I don't want his mother
to see him this way.

42
00:07:16,700 --> 00:07:19,800
Look how they massacred my boy.

43
00:07:49,900 --> 00:07:52,200
It's safer to teach you English!

44
00:07:52,200 --> 00:07:53,700
I know English...

45
00:07:53,700 --> 00:07:59,200
Monday, Tuesday, Thursday,
Wednesday, Friday, Sunday, Saturday.

46
00:08:06,600 --> 00:08:09,000
Greetings, Don Tommasino.

47
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:11,700
How are things in Palermo?

48
00:08:16,800 --> 00:08:23,200
Michael is teaching me to
drive...watch, I'll show you.

49
00:08:23,200 --> 00:08:26,000
How are things in Palermo?

50
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:29,100
Young people don't respect
anything any more...

51
00:08:29,100 --> 00:08:32,200
times are changing for the worse.

52
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:41,400
This place has become
too dangerous for you.

53
00:08:41,400 --> 00:08:48,500
I want you to move to a villa
near Siracusa...right now.

54
00:08:52,100 --> 00:08:54,900
What's wrong?

55
00:08:54,900 --> 00:08:58,800
Bad news from America.

56
00:08:58,800 --> 00:09:03,700
Your brother, Santino,
they killed him.

57
00:09:08,700 --> 00:09:12,200
Let's go...you promised.

58
00:09:30,900 --> 00:09:32,500
Fabrizio!

59
00:09:32,500 --> 00:09:34,300
Get the car.

60
00:09:34,600 --> 00:09:38,600
Are you driving yourself, Boss?
Is your wife coming with you?

61
00:09:38,800 --> 00:09:42,400
No, take her to her father's house
until things are safe.

62
00:09:42,400 --> 00:09:44,800
Okay, anything you say.

63
00:09:50,700 --> 00:09:53,300
Calo, where is Apollonia?

64
00:09:53,300 --> 00:09:57,300
She's going to surprise you.
She wants to drive.

65
00:09:59,100 --> 00:10:02,000
She'll make a good American wife.

66
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:05,000
Wait, I'll get the baggage.

67
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:16,700
Fabrizio!

68
00:10:17,500 --> 00:10:20,100
Where are you going?

69
00:10:20,100 --> 00:10:24,100
Wait there! I'll drive to you.

70
00:10:29,100 --> 00:10:30,500
No, Apollonia!

71
00:10:53,800 --> 00:10:59,500
Don Barzini, I want to thank you
for helping me organise this meeting,

72
00:10:59,500 --> 00:11:04,700
and the other heads of the five families
from New York and New Jersey.

73
00:11:06,300 --> 00:11:09,500
Carmine Cuneo from the Bronx,

74
00:11:09,500 --> 00:11:12,900
and from Brooklyn...

75
00:11:14,600 --> 00:11:16,700
...Philip Tattaglia.

76
00:11:18,200 --> 00:11:21,400
And from Staten Island

77
00:11:21,400 --> 00:11:24,700
we have with us Victor Strachi.

78
00:11:24,700 --> 00:11:30,700
And the other associates that came as
far as from California and Kansas City

79
00:11:30,700 --> 00:11:34,400
and all the other territories
of the country. Thank you.

80
00:11:41,100 --> 00:11:44,700
How did things ever get so far?

81
00:11:44,700 --> 00:11:46,300
I don't know.

82
00:11:48,300 --> 00:11:52,200
It was so unfortunate, so unnecessary.

83
00:11:54,800 --> 00:11:58,800
Tattaglia lost a son, and I lost a son.

84
00:12:00,800 --> 00:12:04,300
We're quits. And if Tattaglia agrees,

85
00:12:04,300 --> 00:12:08,300
then I'm willing to let things go on
as before.

86
00:12:09,800 --> 00:12:13,500
We're grateful to Don Corleone
for calling this meeting.

87
00:12:13,500 --> 00:12:18,900
We all know him as a man of his word.
A modest man who listens to reason.

88
00:12:18,900 --> 00:12:22,900
Yes, Don Barzini. He's too modest.

89
00:12:23,100 --> 00:12:27,100
He had all the judges and politicians
in his pocket.

90
00:12:27,400 --> 00:12:30,400
He refused to share them.

91
00:12:30,400 --> 00:12:34,300
When did I ever refuse
an accommodation?

92
00:12:34,300 --> 00:12:36,600
All of you know me.

93
00:12:37,600 --> 00:12:42,700
When did I ever refuse,
except one time? And why?

94
00:12:44,400 --> 00:12:50,300
Because I believe this drug business
will destroy us in the years to come.

95
00:12:50,300 --> 00:12:54,300
It's not like gambling or liquor
or even women,

96
00:12:54,300 --> 00:13:00,700
which is something that most people
want, but is forbidden by the Church.

97
00:13:00,700 --> 00:13:05,400
Even the police that have helped us in
the past with gambling and other things

98
00:13:05,400 --> 00:13:09,800
are going to refuse to help us
when it comes to narcotics.

99
00:13:09,800 --> 00:13:15,000
I believed that then...
and I believe that now.

100
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:17,300
Times have changed.

101
00:13:17,300 --> 00:13:22,100
It's not like the old days,
when we could do anything we wanted.

102
00:13:22,100 --> 00:13:25,100
A refusal is not the act of a friend.

103
00:13:25,100 --> 00:13:30,700
If Don Corleone had all the judges and
politicians, then he must share them

104
00:13:30,700 --> 00:13:35,500
or let others use them. He must let us
draw the water from the well.

105
00:13:36,300 --> 00:13:40,000
Certainly he can present a bill
for such services.

106
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:42,900
After all, we're not communists.

107
00:13:45,700 --> 00:13:48,900
I also don't believe in drugs.

108
00:13:48,900 --> 00:13:53,700
For years I paid my people extra, so
they wouldn't do that kind of business.

109
00:13:53,700 --> 00:13:57,000
Somebody says to them
"I have powders."

110
00:13:57,000 --> 00:14:03,400
"If you put up 3-4,000 dollar investment,
we can make 50,000 distributing."

111
00:14:04,500 --> 00:14:10,200
They can't resist. I want to control it
as a business, keep it respectable.

112
00:14:10,900 --> 00:14:15,500
I don't want it near schools,
I don't want it sold to children.

113
00:14:15,500 --> 00:14:17,500
That's an infàmia.

114
00:14:18,500 --> 00:14:22,500
In my city we would keep the traffic
to the coloured.

115
00:14:22,600 --> 00:14:25,600
They're animals,
so let them lose their souls.

116
00:14:32,400 --> 00:14:36,400
I hoped that we could come here
and reason together.

117
00:14:37,400 --> 00:14:44,500
And I'm willing to do whatever is
necessary to find a peaceful solution.

118
00:14:44,500 --> 00:14:49,100
We are agreed. The traffic in drugs
will be permitted, but controlled.

119
00:14:49,100 --> 00:14:53,700
Don Corleone will give us protection
in the east, and there will be peace.

120
00:14:53,700 --> 00:14:57,500
I must have strict assurance
from Corleone.

121
00:14:57,500 --> 00:15:01,000
As time goes by and his position
becomes stronger,

122
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:03,400
will he attempt any individual vendetta?

123
00:15:03,400 --> 00:15:09,200
We are all reasonable men.
We don't have to give assurances.

124
00:15:09,200 --> 00:15:11,500
You talk about vengeance.

125
00:15:11,500 --> 00:15:14,800
Will vengeance bring your son
back to you?

126
00:15:14,800 --> 00:15:17,800
Or my boy to me?

127
00:15:17,800 --> 00:15:20,700
I forgo the vengeance of my son.

128
00:15:23,400 --> 00:15:25,900
But I have selfish reasons.

129
00:15:27,900 --> 00:15:31,900
My youngest son was forced
to leave this country...

130
00:15:33,400 --> 00:15:36,000
...because of this Sollozzo business.

131
00:15:37,800 --> 00:15:41,400
And I have to make arrangements
to bring him back here safely.

132
00:15:41,400 --> 00:15:44,200
Cleared of all these false charges.

133
00:15:45,600 --> 00:15:48,800
But I'm a superstitious man.

134
00:15:48,800 --> 00:15:55,600
If an unlucky accident should befall him,
if he should be shot by a police officer,

135
00:15:55,600 --> 00:15:59,300
or if he should hang himself
in his jail cell,

136
00:15:59,300 --> 00:16:02,000
or if he's struck by a bolt of lightning,

137
00:16:03,400 --> 00:16:06,900
then I'm going to blame
some of the people in this room.

138
00:16:08,600 --> 00:16:10,900
And that I do not forgive.

139
00:16:13,400 --> 00:16:15,800
But, that aside...

140
00:16:18,900 --> 00:16:21,300
...let me say that I swear...

141
00:16:22,800 --> 00:16:26,100
...on the souls of my grandchildren,

142
00:16:26,100 --> 00:16:30,100
that I will not be the one to break
the peace we've made here today.

143
00:16:55,900 --> 00:17:01,500
Should I insist that all of Tattaglia's
drug middlemen have clean records?

144
00:17:01,500 --> 00:17:04,000
Mention it. Don't insist.

145
00:17:05,700 --> 00:17:10,600
- Barzini will know without being told.
- You mean Tattaglia.

146
00:17:12,300 --> 00:17:17,500
Tattaglia's a pimp. He could never
have outfought Santino.

147
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:27,000
But I didn't know until this day
that it was Barzini all along.

148
00:17:41,800 --> 00:17:43,900
Come on, Nancy.

149
00:17:45,200 --> 00:17:47,700
Keep together, everyone. Brian.

150
00:17:49,100 --> 00:17:51,100
Okay, all right.

151
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:05,600
How long have you been back?

152
00:18:06,700 --> 00:18:08,600
I've been back a year.

153
00:18:10,100 --> 00:18:12,800
Longer than that, I think.

154
00:18:14,800 --> 00:18:17,100
It's good to see you, Kay.

155
00:18:28,100 --> 00:18:30,700
I'm working for my father now, Kay.

156
00:18:33,100 --> 00:18:36,200
He's been sick. Very sick.

157
00:18:37,800 --> 00:18:44,100
But you're not like him. You told me you
weren't going to become like your father.

158
00:18:45,500 --> 00:18:49,500
My father is no different
than any other powerful man.

159
00:18:49,900 --> 00:18:53,400
Any man who's responsible
for other people.

160
00:18:54,600 --> 00:18:57,100
Like a senator or president.

161
00:18:57,100 --> 00:18:59,600
- How naive you sound.
- Why?

162
00:18:59,600 --> 00:19:02,500
They don't have men killed.

163
00:19:05,600 --> 00:19:07,600
Who's being naive, Kay?

164
00:19:08,900 --> 00:19:13,700
My father's way of doing things is over.
Even he knows that.

165
00:19:14,700 --> 00:19:19,200
In five years the Corleone family
is going to be completely legitimate.

166
00:19:20,900 --> 00:19:24,900
Trust me. That's all I can tell you
about my business. Kay...

167
00:19:26,300 --> 00:19:30,800
Michael, why did you come here? Why?

168
00:19:30,800 --> 00:19:35,600
What do you want with me after all
this time? I've been calling and writing.

169
00:19:35,600 --> 00:19:39,200
I came because I need you.
I care for you.

170
00:19:39,200 --> 00:19:43,200
- Please stop it, Michael.
- Because... I want you to marry me.

171
00:19:44,800 --> 00:19:47,800
- It's too late.
- Please, Kay...

172
00:19:49,100 --> 00:19:53,000
I'll do anything you ask to make up for
what's happened to us.

173
00:19:54,800 --> 00:19:59,500
Because that's important, Kay.
Because what's important is that...

174
00:20:00,700 --> 00:20:04,100
...we have each other.
That we have a life together.

175
00:20:05,500 --> 00:20:08,300
That we have children. Our children.

176
00:20:09,700 --> 00:20:12,300
Kay, I need you.

177
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:16,200
And I love you.

178
00:20:37,500 --> 00:20:41,400
Barzini's people chisel my territory
and we do nothing about it!

179
00:20:41,400 --> 00:20:45,100
- Soon I'll have no place to hang my hat!
- Be patient.

180
00:20:45,100 --> 00:20:48,300
I'm not asking for help.
Just take off the handcuffs.

181
00:20:48,300 --> 00:20:51,800
- Be patient.
- We must protect ourselves.

182
00:20:51,800 --> 00:20:55,300
- Let me recruit some new men.
- No.

183
00:20:55,300 --> 00:20:59,300
- Barzini would get an excuse to fight.
- Mike, you're wrong.

184
00:21:00,500 --> 00:21:02,700
Don Corleone...

185
00:21:02,700 --> 00:21:06,700
You once said that one day Tessio
and me could form our own family.

186
00:21:07,000 --> 00:21:11,400
Till today I would never think of it.
I must ask your permission.

187
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:14,800
Michael is now head of the family.

188
00:21:14,800 --> 00:21:18,800
If he gives his permission,
then you have my blessing.

189
00:21:19,100 --> 00:21:21,500
After we make the move to Nevada

190
00:21:21,500 --> 00:21:26,100
you can leave the Corleone family
and go on your own.

191
00:21:26,100 --> 00:21:30,500
- How long will that be?
- Six months.

192
00:21:30,500 --> 00:21:36,800
Forgive me, but with you gone, me and
Pete will come under Barzini's thumb.

193
00:21:36,800 --> 00:21:42,600
I hate that Barzini. In six months' time
there will be nothing left to build on.

194
00:21:42,600 --> 00:21:45,600
- Do you have faith in my judgement?
- Yes.

195
00:21:45,600 --> 00:21:48,600
- Do I have your loyalty?
- Always, Godfather.

196
00:21:48,600 --> 00:21:52,400
Then be a friend to Michael.
Do as he says.

197
00:21:56,700 --> 00:22:02,100
Things are negotiated that'll solve your
problems and answer your questions.

198
00:22:02,100 --> 00:22:04,200
That's all I can tell you now.

199
00:22:05,300 --> 00:22:07,900
Carlo, you grew up in Nevada.

200
00:22:07,900 --> 00:22:11,300
When we make our move there,
you'll be my right-hand man.

201
00:22:11,300 --> 00:22:16,400
Tom Hagen is no longer consigliere.
He'll be our lawyer in Vegas.

202
00:22:16,400 --> 00:22:19,900
That's no reflection on Tom,
just how I want it.

203
00:22:19,900 --> 00:22:24,500
If I ever need help, who's a better
consigliere than my father? That's it.

204
00:22:43,700 --> 00:22:47,500
- Thank you, Poppa.
- I'm happy for you, Carlo.

205
00:22:47,500 --> 00:22:50,500
Mike... Why am I out?

206
00:22:52,000 --> 00:22:54,800
You're not a wartime consigliere, Tom.

207
00:22:56,000 --> 00:22:58,700
Things may get rough with the move.

208
00:22:59,400 --> 00:23:00,700
Tom.

209
00:23:05,800 --> 00:23:11,100
I advised Michael. I never thought
you were a bad consigliere.

210
00:23:11,100 --> 00:23:16,700
I thought Santino was a bad Don,
rest in peace.

211
00:23:16,700 --> 00:23:19,900
Michael has all my confidence,
just as you do.

212
00:23:21,000 --> 00:23:26,900
But there are reasons why you must
have no part in what is going to happen.

213
00:23:26,900 --> 00:23:30,300
- Maybe I could help.
- You're out, Tom.

214
00:24:19,300 --> 00:24:23,300
I can't get over the way your face looks.
So good!

215
00:24:23,600 --> 00:24:28,300
This doctor did some job. Did Kay
talk you into it? Hey, hey, hey!

216
00:24:28,300 --> 00:24:32,300
Leave them out here.
He's tired and wants to clean up.

217
00:24:32,500 --> 00:24:34,800
Let me open the door, all right?

218
00:24:41,000 --> 00:24:46,800
- Hello, Mike! Welcome to Las Vegas!
- All for you, kid! It's all his idea.

219
00:24:46,800 --> 00:24:49,600
- Your brother Freddy.
- Girls?

220
00:24:53,100 --> 00:24:57,100
I'll be right back. Keep them occupied.

221
00:24:57,400 --> 00:25:01,000
- Anything you want, kid, anything.
- Who are the girls?

222
00:25:02,300 --> 00:25:05,800
- That's for you to find out.
- Get rid of them, Fredo.

223
00:25:07,200 --> 00:25:12,000
- Hey, Mike...
- I'm here on business. Get rid of them.

224
00:25:12,000 --> 00:25:15,300
I'm tired. Get rid of the band too.

225
00:25:20,500 --> 00:25:23,500
Hey, take off. Take off. Let's go.

226
00:25:23,900 --> 00:25:26,000
Hey, that's it. Hey, Angelo.

227
00:25:27,800 --> 00:25:29,900
Hey, come on! Scram!

228
00:25:31,600 --> 00:25:35,100
Come on, honey. I don't know
what's the matter with him, Johnny.

229
00:25:36,500 --> 00:25:38,500
Sorry.

230
00:25:38,500 --> 00:25:41,000
I don't know. He's tired.

231
00:25:48,000 --> 00:25:51,100
What happened to Moe Greene?

232
00:25:51,100 --> 00:25:55,600
He had some business. He said to
give him a call when the party started.

233
00:25:55,600 --> 00:25:57,800
Well, give him a call.

234
00:25:58,900 --> 00:26:02,300
- Johnny, how are you?
- Nice to see you, Mike.

235
00:26:02,300 --> 00:26:04,400
- We're proud of you.
- Thanks.

236
00:26:04,400 --> 00:26:08,100
Sit down, I want to talk to you.
The Don is proud too.

237
00:26:08,100 --> 00:26:11,200
Well, I owe it all to him.

238
00:26:11,200 --> 00:26:16,500
He knows how grateful you are. That's
why he'd like to ask a favour of you.

239
00:26:16,500 --> 00:26:18,400
Mike, what can I do?

240
00:26:19,600 --> 00:26:25,800
We're thinking of giving up our interests
in the olive oil business and settle here.

241
00:26:25,800 --> 00:26:32,000
Moe will sell us his share of the casino
and the hotel, so we'll own all of it. Tom!

242
00:26:32,000 --> 00:26:37,200
Are you sure? Moe loves the business.
He never said nothing about selling.

243
00:26:37,200 --> 00:26:40,100
I'll make him an offer he can't refuse.

244
00:26:41,300 --> 00:26:43,800
See, Johnny...

245
00:26:43,800 --> 00:26:47,800
We figure that entertainment
would draw gamblers to the casino.

246
00:26:48,100 --> 00:26:51,700
We hope you'll sign a contract
to appear five times a year.

247
00:26:54,700 --> 00:26:59,500
Perhaps convince some of your friends
in the movies to do the same.

248
00:27:00,500 --> 00:27:02,600
We're counting on you.

249
00:27:04,700 --> 00:27:08,700
Sure, Mike. I'll do anything
for my godfather.

250
00:27:08,700 --> 00:27:10,000
Good.

251
00:27:11,500 --> 00:27:16,400
Hey, Mike! Hello, fellows.
Everybody's here. Freddy, Tom.

252
00:27:16,400 --> 00:27:18,800
- Good to see you.
- How are you, Moe?

253
00:27:18,800 --> 00:27:24,000
Have everything? Specially prepared
food, the best dancers, and good credit.

254
00:27:24,000 --> 00:27:27,200
Draw chips for everybody,
so they can play on the house.

255
00:27:30,200 --> 00:27:33,300
Is my credit good enough
to buy you out?

256
00:27:34,800 --> 00:27:36,600
Buy me out?

257
00:27:36,600 --> 00:27:41,600
The casino, the hotel. The
Corleone family wants to buy you out.

258
00:27:42,300 --> 00:27:47,800
The Corleone family wants to
buy me out? No, I buy you out.

259
00:27:47,800 --> 00:27:51,300
Your casino loses money.
We can do better.

260
00:27:51,300 --> 00:27:55,800
- You think I'm skimming off the top?
- You're unlucky.

261
00:28:00,100 --> 00:28:02,600
You Guineas make me laugh.

262
00:28:02,600 --> 00:28:07,400
I took Freddy in when you had a bad
time, and now you try to push me out!

263
00:28:08,500 --> 00:28:12,000
You did that because we bankrolled
your casino

264
00:28:12,000 --> 00:28:17,400
and the Molinari family guaranteed
his safety. Let's talk business.

265
00:28:17,400 --> 00:28:22,800
Yes. First of all, you're all done. You
don't have that kind of muscle anymore.

266
00:28:22,800 --> 00:28:27,300
The Godfather is sick. You're getting
chased out of New York by the others.

267
00:28:27,300 --> 00:28:31,300
Do you think you can come to my hotel
and take over?

268
00:28:31,300 --> 00:28:36,400
I talked to Barzini. I can make a deal
with him and still keep my hotel!

269
00:28:36,400 --> 00:28:39,100
Is that why you slapped my brother
around in public?

270
00:28:40,000 --> 00:28:44,900
That was nothing, Mike.
Moe didn't mean nothing by that.

271
00:28:44,900 --> 00:28:48,900
He flies off the handle sometimes,
but we're good friends.

272
00:28:49,200 --> 00:28:54,100
I have a business to run.
I've got to kick asses sometimes.

273
00:28:54,100 --> 00:28:58,100
We had an argument,
so I had to straighten him out.

274
00:28:58,100 --> 00:29:00,900
You straightened my brother out?

275
00:29:00,900 --> 00:29:05,500
He was banging cocktail waitresses!
Players couldn't get a drink.

276
00:29:05,500 --> 00:29:07,600
What's wrong with you?

277
00:29:12,300 --> 00:29:15,900
I leave for New York tomorrow.
Think about a price.

278
00:29:16,600 --> 00:29:18,000
Son-of-a-bitch!

279
00:29:18,000 --> 00:29:23,400
I'm Moe Greene! I made my bones
when you were out with cheerleaders.

280
00:29:23,400 --> 00:29:25,900
Wait a minute, Moe. I have an idea.

281
00:29:26,900 --> 00:29:30,600
Tom, you're the consigliere.
Talk to the Don...

282
00:29:30,600 --> 00:29:35,900
Just a minute. Don is semi-retired and
Mike is in charge of the family business.

283
00:29:35,900 --> 00:29:39,200
If you have anything to say,
say it to Michael.

284
00:29:43,200 --> 00:29:48,400
Mike, you don't come to Las Vegas and
talk to a man like Moe Greene like that!

285
00:29:50,000 --> 00:29:51,200
Fredo...

286
00:29:52,300 --> 00:29:55,200
You're my older brother, and I love you.

287
00:29:56,600 --> 00:30:00,600
But don't ever take sides with anyone
against the family again.

288
00:30:11,100 --> 00:30:15,400
I have to see my father and his people,
so have dinner without me.

289
00:30:17,100 --> 00:30:22,300
This weekend we'll go out. We'll go to
the city, see a show and have dinner.

290
00:30:29,200 --> 00:30:32,400
Your sister wants to ask you something.

291
00:30:32,400 --> 00:30:34,700
- Let her ask.
- She's afraid to.

292
00:30:34,700 --> 00:30:37,800
They want you to be godfather
to their boy.

293
00:30:37,800 --> 00:30:39,700
- We'll see.
- Will you?

294
00:30:39,700 --> 00:30:41,900
Let me think about it. Come on.

295
00:30:50,700 --> 00:30:53,700
Barzini will move against you first.

296
00:30:53,700 --> 00:30:58,300
He'll set up a meeting with someone
you absolutely trust.

297
00:30:58,300 --> 00:31:00,500
Guaranteeing your safety.

298
00:31:01,500 --> 00:31:05,000
And at that meeting
you'll be assassinated.

299
00:31:09,500 --> 00:31:12,900
I like to drink wine more than I used to.

300
00:31:13,900 --> 00:31:17,700
- Anyway, I'm drinking more.
- It's good for you, Pop.

301
00:31:22,500 --> 00:31:24,000
I don't know.

302
00:31:25,900 --> 00:31:28,800
Are you happy with your wife
and children?

303
00:31:29,800 --> 00:31:33,000
- Very happy.
- That's good.

304
00:31:34,500 --> 00:31:39,500
I hope you don't mind the way I keep
going over this Barzini business.

305
00:31:39,500 --> 00:31:42,900
- No, not at all.
- It's an old habit.

306
00:31:43,900 --> 00:31:46,900
I spend my life trying not to be careless.

307
00:31:48,500 --> 00:31:52,000
Women and children can be careless,
but not men.

308
00:31:55,200 --> 00:31:57,700
- How's your boy?
- He's good.

309
00:31:57,700 --> 00:32:00,900
He looks more like you every day.

310
00:32:03,200 --> 00:32:07,500
He's smarter than I am. He's three
and can read the funny papers.

311
00:32:09,700 --> 00:32:11,900
Read the funny papers.

312
00:32:19,000 --> 00:32:24,800
I want you to arrange for a telephone
man to check all in- and out-going calls.

313
00:32:24,800 --> 00:32:30,600
- I did it already. I took care of that, Pop.
- That's right. I forgot.

314
00:32:34,200 --> 00:32:36,700
What's the matter?

315
00:32:36,700 --> 00:32:38,800
What's bothering you?

316
00:32:42,300 --> 00:32:46,800
I'll handle it. I told you I can handle it,
so I'll handle it.

317
00:33:00,200 --> 00:33:04,800
I knew that Santino would have to
go through all this.

318
00:33:04,800 --> 00:33:06,800
And Fredo...

319
00:33:09,100 --> 00:33:11,500
Fredo was, well...

320
00:33:13,000 --> 00:33:16,300
But I never wanted this for you.

321
00:33:18,100 --> 00:33:23,300
I worked my whole life. I don't apologise
for taking care of my family.

322
00:33:23,300 --> 00:33:27,300
And I refused to be a fool,

323
00:33:27,300 --> 00:33:31,800
dancing on a string
held by all those big shots.

324
00:33:33,400 --> 00:33:36,800
I don't apologise. That's my life,
but I thought that...

325
00:33:38,600 --> 00:33:43,800
...that when it was your time, you would
be the one to hold the strings.

326
00:33:45,500 --> 00:33:51,200
Senator Corleone. Governor Corleone.
Something.

327
00:33:51,200 --> 00:33:54,400
Another pezzo da novanta.

328
00:33:54,400 --> 00:33:56,000
Well...

329
00:33:59,200 --> 00:34:03,200
Just wasn't enough time, Michael.
Wasn't enough time.

330
00:34:03,300 --> 00:34:07,200
We'll get there, Pop. We'll get there.

331
00:34:11,600 --> 00:34:16,100
Now listen, whoever comes to you
with this Barzini meeting,

332
00:34:16,100 --> 00:34:19,600
he's the traitor. Don't forget that.

333
00:34:36,200 --> 00:34:38,900
Can I hold it, please?

334
00:34:53,300 --> 00:34:57,300
- Can I water these?
- Yes, go ahead.

335
00:34:57,400 --> 00:35:00,500
Over here, over here.

336
00:35:02,100 --> 00:35:05,100
Be careful. You're spilling it.

337
00:35:10,900 --> 00:35:12,400
Antony!

338
00:35:12,400 --> 00:35:14,100
Come here, come here.

339
00:35:18,700 --> 00:35:21,400
That's it. We'll put it right there.

340
00:35:27,500 --> 00:35:30,400
I'll show you something. Come here.

341
00:35:32,000 --> 00:35:33,900
Stand there.

342
00:35:37,700 --> 00:35:39,900
Give me an orange!

343
00:35:57,800 --> 00:35:59,800
That's a new trick.

344
00:36:00,800 --> 00:36:03,500
You run in there. Run in there.

345
00:36:16,600 --> 00:36:18,500
Where are you?

346
00:39:16,100 --> 00:39:18,500
Mike, can I have a minute?

347
00:39:28,500 --> 00:39:31,000
Barzini wants to arrange a meeting.

348
00:39:31,000 --> 00:39:34,000
He says we can straighten out
any of our problems.

349
00:39:35,200 --> 00:39:37,600
- You talked to him?
- Yeah.

350
00:39:38,600 --> 00:39:42,600
I can arrange security. On my territory.

351
00:39:45,500 --> 00:39:48,500
- All right?
- All right.

352
00:40:05,600 --> 00:40:08,400
Do you know how they're going to
come at you?

353
00:40:11,100 --> 00:40:15,100
They're arranging a meeting
in Brooklyn. Tessio's ground.

354
00:40:16,800 --> 00:40:18,800
Where I'll be safe.

355
00:40:30,900 --> 00:40:34,600
I always thought it would be
Clemenza, not Tessio.

356
00:40:34,600 --> 00:40:39,000
It's the smart move.
Tessio was always smarter.

357
00:40:40,600 --> 00:40:43,100
But I'm going to wait.

358
00:40:43,100 --> 00:40:45,300
After the baptism.

359
00:40:47,400 --> 00:40:50,100
I've decided to be godfather
to Connie's baby.

360
00:40:51,300 --> 00:40:54,500
And then I'll meet with Don Barzini

361
00:40:54,500 --> 00:40:59,300
and Tattaglia.
All the heads of the five families.

362
00:43:20,700 --> 00:43:25,700
Michael, do you believe in God, the
Father, Creator of Heaven and Earth?

363
00:43:25,700 --> 00:43:26,900
I do.

364
00:43:26,900 --> 00:43:30,600
Do you believe in Jesus Christ,
His only Son, our Lord?

365
00:43:30,600 --> 00:43:31,900
I do.

366
00:43:31,900 --> 00:43:35,900
Do you believe in the Holy Ghost,
the Holy Catholic Church?

367
00:43:36,100 --> 00:43:37,300
I do.

368
00:44:42,800 --> 00:44:47,200
Michael Francis Rizzi,
do you renounce Satan?

369
00:44:53,200 --> 00:44:54,700
I do renounce him.

370
00:45:04,300 --> 00:45:05,800
And all his works?

371
00:45:19,600 --> 00:45:20,700
I do renounce them.

372
00:45:22,500 --> 00:45:23,700
Oh, God!

373
00:45:26,400 --> 00:45:30,400
- And all his pomps?
- I do renounce them.

374
00:45:45,800 --> 00:45:50,300
Michael Rizzi, will you be baptised?

375
00:45:50,300 --> 00:45:51,500
I will.

376
00:45:58,800 --> 00:46:04,700
Michael Rizzi, go in peace, and may
the Lord be with you. Amen.

377
00:46:18,400 --> 00:46:20,400
Kay!

378
00:46:20,400 --> 00:46:22,500
Kiss your godfather.

379
00:46:46,700 --> 00:46:52,600
Can't go to Vegas. Something's come
up. Everybody has to leave without us.

380
00:46:52,600 --> 00:46:56,200
- Mike, it's our first vacation!
- Connie, please.

381
00:46:56,200 --> 00:46:59,400
Go back to the house, wait for my call.
It's important.

382
00:47:00,700 --> 00:47:03,100
I'll only be a couple of days.

383
00:47:19,100 --> 00:47:21,300
We're on our way to Brooklyn.

384
00:47:23,400 --> 00:47:27,400
- I hope Mike can get us a good deal.
- I'm sure he will.

385
00:47:34,900 --> 00:47:40,500
Sal, Tom, the boss says he'll come in a
separate car, so you two go on ahead.

386
00:47:40,500 --> 00:47:44,100
- That screws up my arrangements.
- That's what he said.

387
00:47:44,100 --> 00:47:46,200
I can't go either, Sal.

388
00:47:58,200 --> 00:48:02,900
Tell Mike it was only business.
I always liked him.

389
00:48:03,800 --> 00:48:06,800
- He understands that.
- Excuse me, Sal.

390
00:48:12,700 --> 00:48:15,100
Tom, can you get me off the hook?

391
00:48:16,200 --> 00:48:19,500
- For old times' sake?
- Can't do it, Sally.

392
00:49:05,000 --> 00:49:07,300
You have to answer for Santino, Carlo.

393
00:49:12,500 --> 00:49:16,400
- Mike, you got it all wrong.
- You fingered Sonny for Barzini.

394
00:49:17,600 --> 00:49:21,400
That little farce you played
with my sister.

395
00:49:21,400 --> 00:49:26,800
- You think that could fool a Corleone?
- I'm innocent. I swear on the kids.

396
00:49:26,800 --> 00:49:30,100
- Please, don't do this.
- Sit down.

397
00:49:32,200 --> 00:49:34,700
Don't do this to me, please.

398
00:49:43,700 --> 00:49:45,800
Barzini is dead.

399
00:49:47,400 --> 00:49:49,800
So is Philip Tattaglia.

400
00:49:51,100 --> 00:49:52,500
Moe Greene.

401
00:49:53,500 --> 00:49:57,900
Strachi. Cuneo.

402
00:49:59,200 --> 00:50:03,600
Today I settle all family business,
so don't tell me you're innocent, Carlo.

403
00:50:04,600 --> 00:50:06,800
Admit what you did.

404
00:50:10,200 --> 00:50:12,200
Get him a drink.

405
00:50:18,400 --> 00:50:19,500
Come on.

406
00:50:20,800 --> 00:50:25,700
Don't be afraid, Carlo. Do you think
I'd make my sister a widow?

407
00:50:27,300 --> 00:50:30,300
I'm godfather to your son, Carlo.

408
00:50:37,000 --> 00:50:39,300
Go ahead, drink, drink.

409
00:50:43,900 --> 00:50:47,800
No, you're out of the family business.
That's your punishment.

410
00:50:48,800 --> 00:50:52,800
You're finished.
I'm putting you on a plane to Vegas.

411
00:50:52,800 --> 00:50:54,500
Tom.

412
00:50:58,500 --> 00:51:02,300
I want you to stay there. Understand?

413
00:51:02,300 --> 00:51:05,200
Only don't tell me you're innocent.

414
00:51:06,200 --> 00:51:10,900
Because it insults my intelligence.
Makes me very angry.

415
00:51:14,700 --> 00:51:16,700
Who approached you?

416
00:51:18,000 --> 00:51:20,400
Tattaglia or Barzini?

417
00:51:28,100 --> 00:51:30,900
It was Barzini.

418
00:51:34,000 --> 00:51:35,600
Good.

419
00:51:41,700 --> 00:51:45,700
There's a car waiting outside
to take you to the airport.

420
00:51:45,900 --> 00:51:49,000
I'll call your wife and tell her
what flight you're on.

421
00:51:53,800 --> 00:51:56,600
- Mike...
- Get out of my sight.

422
00:52:22,400 --> 00:52:24,100
Hello, Carlo.

423
00:53:23,600 --> 00:53:27,000
- I'm trying to tell you...
- Mama, please!

424
00:53:35,300 --> 00:53:37,600
Michael!

425
00:53:37,600 --> 00:53:40,600
- What is it?
- Where is he?

426
00:53:42,100 --> 00:53:47,200
Michael, you lousy bastard!
You killed my husband.

427
00:53:47,200 --> 00:53:51,200
You waited until Papa died,
so nobody could stop you.

428
00:53:51,400 --> 00:53:54,500
You blamed him for Sonny.
Everybody did.

429
00:53:54,500 --> 00:54:00,500
But you never thought about me!
Now what are we going to do?

430
00:54:00,500 --> 00:54:02,200
Connie.

431
00:54:04,400 --> 00:54:10,000
Why do you think he kept Carlo at the
Mall? He knew he was going to kill him.

432
00:54:10,000 --> 00:54:15,400
And you stood godfather to our baby.
You lousy cold-hearted bastard!

433
00:54:15,400 --> 00:54:19,400
Want to know how many men he had
killed with Carlo? Read the papers!

434
00:54:19,600 --> 00:54:23,200
That's your husband,
that's your husband!

435
00:54:32,200 --> 00:54:35,700
No! No, no...

436
00:54:36,300 --> 00:54:39,700
Take her upstairs. Get her a doctor.

437
00:55:00,800 --> 00:55:02,500
She's hysterical.

438
00:55:07,300 --> 00:55:08,900
Hysterical.

439
00:55:10,800 --> 00:55:12,000
Michael, is it true?

440
00:55:14,600 --> 00:55:18,300
- Don't ask me about my business, Kay.
- Is it true?

441
00:55:18,300 --> 00:55:21,500
Don't ask me about my business.
Enough!

442
00:55:41,300 --> 00:55:42,700
All right.

443
00:55:45,500 --> 00:55:47,400
This one time.

444
00:55:51,200 --> 00:55:53,800
This one time I'll let you ask me
about my affairs.

445
00:56:00,700 --> 00:56:01,900
Is it true?

446
00:56:06,300 --> 00:56:07,800
Is it?

447
00:56:09,400 --> 00:56:10,800
No.

448
00:56:24,500 --> 00:56:28,100
I guess we both need a drink. Come on.

449
00:56:58,900 --> 00:57:00,700
Don Corleone.
