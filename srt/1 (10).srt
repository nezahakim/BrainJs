1
00:01:35,516 --> 00:01:36,915
Hey, come on.

2
00:01:37,017 --> 00:01:38,416
Come on. Let's go.

3
00:02:35,175 --> 00:02:36,574
Joe, you take over.

4
00:02:40,514 --> 00:02:41,913
Hi, Grandpa.

5
00:02:54,461 --> 00:02:56,349
I love you, Grandpa.

6
00:02:58,966 --> 00:03:01,696
I'm sorry, Pa.
He doesn't know you yet.

7
00:03:03,437 --> 00:03:06,201
Here you are, big guy.
Give it to Grandpa.

8
00:03:06,307 --> 00:03:08,366
"I hope you get well, Grandpa...

9
00:03:08,475 --> 00:03:10,363
and I wish
I would see you soon.

10
00:03:10,477 --> 00:03:12,707
Love, your grandson, Frank. "

11
00:03:15,482 --> 00:03:17,712
Go with your mother.

12
00:03:17,818 --> 00:03:19,376
Go ahead.
Take 'em downstairs.

13
00:03:25,993 --> 00:03:27,551
Go on, Carlo.
You too.

14
00:03:29,830 --> 00:03:31,229
Go on.

15
00:03:34,835 --> 00:03:38,066
I got chicken cacciatore
for you, sweetheart.

16
00:03:38,172 --> 00:03:39,969
- That's enough bread.
- I love bread.

17
00:03:40,074 --> 00:03:41,564
But how much can you eat?

18
00:03:52,119 --> 00:03:54,007
What's the matter with you, Carlo?

19
00:03:54,121 --> 00:03:55,884
Shut up and set the table.

20
00:04:11,805 --> 00:04:14,365
Since McCluskey's killing...

21
00:04:14,475 --> 00:04:17,865
the police have been cracking down
on most of our operations.

22
00:04:19,646 --> 00:04:21,375
And also the other families'.

23
00:04:22,649 --> 00:04:24,344
Been a lot of bad blood.

24
00:04:24,451 --> 00:04:27,943
They hit us,
so we hit them back.

25
00:04:28,822 --> 00:04:30,881
Through our contacts
in the newspapers...

26
00:04:30,991 --> 00:04:33,221
we've been able to put out
a lot of material...

27
00:04:33,327 --> 00:04:36,717
about McCluskey being linked
with Sollozzo in the drug rackets.

28
00:04:37,998 --> 00:04:39,886
See, things are
starting to loosen up.

29
00:04:41,101 --> 00:04:45,834
Dad, I'm sending Fredo
to Las Vegas...

30
00:04:45,939 --> 00:04:48,533
under the protection
of Don Francesco of L.A.

31
00:04:48,642 --> 00:04:50,507
I want him to rest.

32
00:04:50,611 --> 00:04:53,000
I'm going to learn
the casino business.

33
00:04:53,113 --> 00:04:54,478
Yeah.

34
00:05:01,288 --> 00:05:02,778
Where is Michael?

35
00:05:15,636 --> 00:05:18,230
It was Michael
who killed Sollozzo.

36
00:05:20,641 --> 00:05:24,372
But he's safe. We're starting
to work to bring him back now.

37
00:05:46,100 --> 00:05:48,159
I want you to find out where that
little pimp Tattaglia is hiding.

38
00:05:48,268 --> 00:05:50,156
I want his ass now-
right now.

39
00:05:50,270 --> 00:05:51,999
- Hey, Sonny.
- What?

40
00:05:52,106 --> 00:05:53,835
Things are starting to loosen up
a little bit.

41
00:05:53,941 --> 00:05:56,671
If you go after Tattaglia,
all hell's going to break loose.

42
00:05:56,777 --> 00:05:58,665
Let the smoke clear.
Pop can negotiate.

43
00:05:58,779 --> 00:06:01,168
No, Pop can't do nothing till
he's better. I'm gonna decide-

44
00:06:01,281 --> 00:06:03,169
All right, but your war's
costing us a lot of money.

45
00:06:03,283 --> 00:06:05,012
Nothing's coming in.
We can't do business.

46
00:06:05,119 --> 00:06:07,849
Neither can they.
Don't worry about it.

47
00:06:07,955 --> 00:06:09,843
- We can't afford a stalemate.
- Then there ain't no more stalemate.

48
00:06:09,957 --> 00:06:11,845
I'm gonna end it
by killing that old bastard.

49
00:06:11,959 --> 00:06:14,018
You're getting a great reputation.
I hope you're enjoying it.

50
00:06:14,128 --> 00:06:15,686
Do what I tell you to do!

51
00:06:15,796 --> 00:06:17,855
Goddamn it, if I had a wartime
consigliere- a Sicilian-

52
00:06:17,965 --> 00:06:19,853
I wouldn't be in this shape!

53
00:06:19,967 --> 00:06:21,923
Pop had Genco.
Look what I got.

54
00:06:25,806 --> 00:06:27,694
I'm sorry.
I didn't mean that.

55
00:06:29,309 --> 00:06:32,335
Mom made a little dinner.
It's Sunday.

56
00:06:33,313 --> 00:06:36,043
Niggers are having
a good time...

57
00:06:36,150 --> 00:06:37,708
with our policy banks
up there in Harlem.

58
00:06:37,818 --> 00:06:41,640
Driving them new Cadillacs,
paying 50% on a bet.

59
00:06:41,755 --> 00:06:45,145
I knew that was gonna happen as soon
as they started making big money.

60
00:06:45,259 --> 00:06:48,820
Papa never talked business
at the table in front of the kids.

61
00:06:48,929 --> 00:06:51,659
- Shut up, Connie.
- Don't you ever tell her to shut up.

62
00:06:51,765 --> 00:06:54,825
- You got that?
- Santino, don't interfere.

63
00:06:56,770 --> 00:06:59,330
Sonny, Tom, I'd like to talk
to you, maybe after dinner.

64
00:06:59,439 --> 00:07:01,327
I could be doing more
for the family.

65
00:07:01,441 --> 00:07:03,397
We don't discuss business
at the table.

66
00:08:28,795 --> 00:08:30,285
Corleone.

67
00:09:40,133 --> 00:09:43,466
Hey, American!
Take me to America! G.I.!

68
00:09:45,072 --> 00:09:48,132
Take me to America, G.I.
Clark Gable.

69
00:12:47,954 --> 00:12:50,013
I apologize if I offended you.

70
00:12:51,291 --> 00:12:52,690
I'm a stranger in this country...

71
00:12:54,294 --> 00:12:57,183
and I meant no disrespect
to you or your daughter.

72
00:13:02,969 --> 00:13:05,199
I'm an American hiding in Sicily.

73
00:13:07,140 --> 00:13:08,539
My name is Michael Corleone.

74
00:13:11,478 --> 00:13:13,969
There are people who would pay
a lot of money for that information.

75
00:13:17,984 --> 00:13:19,872
But then your daughter
would lose a father...

76
00:13:22,422 --> 00:13:24,049
instead of gaining a husband.

77
00:13:32,666 --> 00:13:34,293
I want to meet your daughter...

78
00:13:36,002 --> 00:13:37,731
with your permission...

79
00:13:37,837 --> 00:13:40,067
and under the supervision
of your family...

80
00:13:41,274 --> 00:13:42,673
with all respect.

81
00:14:01,461 --> 00:14:02,485
Apollonia.

82
00:16:55,268 --> 00:16:57,156
Hey! I'm gonna knock you dizzy.

83
00:17:03,276 --> 00:17:05,005
Save it for the library.

84
00:17:08,915 --> 00:17:11,179
Come on. We gotta go
pick up my sister. Let's go.

85
00:17:29,636 --> 00:17:31,035
What's the matter?

86
00:17:37,143 --> 00:17:39,202
- It was my fault!
- Where is he?

87
00:17:39,312 --> 00:17:42,702
Sonny, please. It was my fault.
I hit him.

88
00:17:42,816 --> 00:17:44,647
I started a fight with him.
Please, Sonny.

89
00:17:44,751 --> 00:17:46,150
I'm sorry.

90
00:17:51,925 --> 00:17:54,655
I'm just gonna get a doctor
to come and take a look at you.

91
00:17:54,761 --> 00:17:57,491
Sonny, please don't do anything.

92
00:17:59,599 --> 00:18:01,658
What's the matter with you?
What am I gonna do?

93
00:18:01,768 --> 00:18:04,566
Am I gonna make that baby an orphan
before he's born?

94
00:18:07,440 --> 00:18:08,839
All right?

95
00:18:08,942 --> 00:18:12,036
Still betting the Yankees
pretty heavy?

96
00:18:12,145 --> 00:18:14,511
Tell him to stop
taking action, all right?

97
00:18:15,815 --> 00:18:17,771
You lost enough money
last weekend to me.

98
00:18:24,190 --> 00:18:25,589
Carlo, come here.

99
00:19:23,783 --> 00:19:26,513
You touch my sister again,
I'll kill you.

100
00:23:21,854 --> 00:23:24,584
Weren't expecting you.
You should call.

101
00:23:24,690 --> 00:23:28,979
Yes, well, I have.
I've tried writing and calling.

102
00:23:29,095 --> 00:23:31,359
Now, I wanna reach Michael.

103
00:23:31,464 --> 00:23:34,854
Nobody knows where he is. We know
he's all right, but that's all.

104
00:23:38,137 --> 00:23:40,025
- What was that?
- That's an accident.

105
00:23:40,139 --> 00:23:42,835
But nobody was hurt.

106
00:23:44,410 --> 00:23:48,232
Would you give this letter
to Michael, please?

107
00:23:48,347 --> 00:23:50,577
Well, if I accepted that...

108
00:23:50,683 --> 00:23:54,244
in a court of law they could prove
I have knowledge of his whereabouts.

109
00:23:54,353 --> 00:23:56,446
Just be patient.
He'll get in touch with you.

110
00:23:56,556 --> 00:24:00,447
I let my cab go.
Can I come in to call another one?

111
00:24:00,560 --> 00:24:02,448
Come on. I'm sorry.
Come on.

112
00:24:19,378 --> 00:24:20,777
Hello?

113
00:24:23,449 --> 00:24:25,110
Is Carlo there?

114
00:24:25,218 --> 00:24:27,584
- Who's this?
- This is a friend of Carlo’s.

115
00:24:27,687 --> 00:24:30,747
Would you tell him that
I can't make it tonight until later?

116
00:24:36,963 --> 00:24:38,362
Bitch.

117
00:24:40,233 --> 00:24:42,827
- Dinner's on the table.
- I'm not hungry yet.

118
00:24:42,935 --> 00:24:44,823
Your food is on the table.
It's getting cold.

119
00:24:44,937 --> 00:24:47,997
- I'll eat out later.
- You told me to make you dinner.

120
00:24:48,107 --> 00:24:49,995
Hey, vaffancolo, eh?

121
00:24:50,109 --> 00:24:52,236
I'll vaffanculo you!

122
00:24:57,316 --> 00:24:59,807
This little guinea brat.

123
00:25:04,223 --> 00:25:06,817
That's it. Break it all,
you spoiled guinea brat.

124
00:25:06,926 --> 00:25:08,484
Break it all!

125
00:25:12,131 --> 00:25:14,019
That's it.
Break it all.

126
00:25:17,737 --> 00:25:21,935
Why don't you bring
your whore home for dinner?

127
00:25:22,041 --> 00:25:24,407
Maybe I will.
Why not?

128
00:25:30,216 --> 00:25:32,582
- Now clean it up!
- Like hell I will!

129
00:25:32,685 --> 00:25:35,074
Clean it up,
you guinea spoiled brat!

130
00:25:35,187 --> 00:25:37,519
Clean it up!
Clean it up!

131
00:25:42,094 --> 00:25:43,982
You son of a bitch!

132
00:25:53,272 --> 00:25:56,366
Come on, now! Kill me!
Be a murderer like your father!

133
00:25:56,475 --> 00:25:58,705
- All you Corleones are murderers!
- I hate you!

134
00:25:58,811 --> 00:26:00,438
- Come on!
- I'll kill you!

135
00:26:00,546 --> 00:26:02,935
Kill me!
Get up!

136
00:26:03,049 --> 00:26:04,573
Get out of here!

137
00:26:04,684 --> 00:26:08,176
- I hate you!
- Now I'll kill you.

138
00:26:08,287 --> 00:26:10,175
You guinea brat, you.

139
00:26:10,289 --> 00:26:11,847
Get out here!

140
00:26:21,634 --> 00:26:24,558
Connie, what's the matter?
I can't hear you. What is it?

141
00:26:25,738 --> 00:26:28,593
Talk louder.
The baby's crying.

142
00:26:28,708 --> 00:26:30,630
Santino, I can't understand-
I don't know.

143
00:26:30,743 --> 00:26:32,699
I don't understand.

144
00:26:32,812 --> 00:26:34,211
Yeah, Connie.

145
00:26:39,852 --> 00:26:41,740
Listen, you wait there.

146
00:26:44,223 --> 00:26:46,487
No, you just wait there.

147
00:26:48,527 --> 00:26:51,416
- That son of a bitch.
- Sonny, what's the matter?

148
00:26:51,530 --> 00:26:53,555
- Son of a bitch!
- What's the matter?

149
00:26:53,666 --> 00:26:54,758
Damn it!

150
00:26:58,337 --> 00:27:00,965
Open the goddamn gate.
Get off your ass.

151
00:27:17,490 --> 00:27:20,323
- Sonny, come on!
- Get out of here!

152
00:27:20,426 --> 00:27:22,314
Go after him.
Go on.

153
00:27:51,323 --> 00:27:53,154
Son of a bitch.

154
00:27:53,259 --> 00:27:55,284
Come on! Come on!

155
00:29:42,835 --> 00:29:44,894
Give me a drop.

156
00:29:52,945 --> 00:29:55,072
My wife is crying upstairs.

157
00:29:57,616 --> 00:29:59,743
I hear cars coming to the house.

158
00:30:04,690 --> 00:30:06,521
Consigliere of mine...

159
00:30:08,060 --> 00:30:10,984
I think you should tell your Don
what everyone seems to know.

160
00:30:11,096 --> 00:30:13,223
I didn't tell Mama anything.

161
00:30:14,800 --> 00:30:18,327
I was about to come up and wake you
just now and tell you.

162
00:30:21,473 --> 00:30:23,395
But you needed a drink first.

163
00:30:30,549 --> 00:30:32,437
Now you've had your drink.

164
00:30:38,591 --> 00:30:42,755
They shot Sonny on the causeway.
He's dead.

165
00:31:00,045 --> 00:31:02,411
I want all inquiries made.

166
00:31:06,719 --> 00:31:08,607
I want no acts of vengeance.

167
00:31:10,756 --> 00:31:12,644
I want you to arrange a meeting...

168
00:31:14,560 --> 00:31:16,516
with the heads
of the five families.

169
00:31:19,298 --> 00:31:21,220
This war stops now.

170
00:31:43,255 --> 00:31:45,780
Call Bonasera.

171
00:31:45,891 --> 00:31:47,779
We need him now.

172
00:32:00,239 --> 00:32:03,197
This is Tom Hagen
calling for Vito Corleone...

173
00:32:03,308 --> 00:32:05,299
at his request.

174
00:32:05,411 --> 00:32:07,606
Now, you owe your Don a service.

175
00:32:07,713 --> 00:32:11,535
He has no doubt that
you will repay it.

176
00:32:11,650 --> 00:32:14,414
Now, he will be at your
funeral parlor in one hour.

177
00:32:14,520 --> 00:32:16,408
Be there to greet him.

178
00:32:37,242 --> 00:32:39,472
Well, my friend...

179
00:32:39,578 --> 00:32:41,944
are you ready
to do me this service?

180
00:32:42,047 --> 00:32:43,605
Yes.

181
00:32:43,716 --> 00:32:46,241
What do you want me to do?

182
00:32:53,592 --> 00:32:56,618
I want you to use
all your powers...

183
00:32:56,729 --> 00:32:58,617
and all your skills.

184
00:33:02,234 --> 00:33:04,600
I don't want his mother
to see him this way.

185
00:33:21,286 --> 00:33:23,777
Look how they massacred my boy.

186
00:33:58,657 --> 00:34:00,454
Monday, Tuesday, Thursday...

187
00:34:00,559 --> 00:34:03,187
Wednesday, Friday,
Sunday, Saturday.

188
00:35:35,587 --> 00:35:36,849
- Fabrizio.
- Yes, sir?

189
00:35:39,224 --> 00:35:40,782
Are you driving yourself, boss?

190
00:35:40,893 --> 00:35:43,088
- Yes.
- Is your wife coming with you?

191
00:35:43,195 --> 00:35:46,756
Take her to her father's house
till I know things are safe.

192
00:35:46,865 --> 00:35:48,753
Anything you say, boss.

193
00:36:58,403 --> 00:37:00,234
Don Barzini,
I want to thank you...

194
00:37:00,339 --> 00:37:03,866
for helping me organize
this meeting here today.

195
00:37:03,976 --> 00:37:07,332
And also the other heads
of the five families...

196
00:37:07,446 --> 00:37:09,334
from New York and New Jersey.

197
00:37:10,949 --> 00:37:13,975
Carmine Cuneo from the Bronx.

198
00:37:16,455 --> 00:37:18,013
From Brooklyn...

199
00:37:19,124 --> 00:37:20,557
Philip Tattaglia.

200
00:37:23,028 --> 00:37:25,861
And from Staten Island...

201
00:37:25,964 --> 00:37:29,229
we have with us Victor Strachi.

202
00:37:29,334 --> 00:37:31,825
And all the other associates
that came as far...

203
00:37:31,903 --> 00:37:35,031
as from California
and Kansas City...

204
00:37:35,140 --> 00:37:37,472
and all the other territories
of the country.

205
00:37:37,576 --> 00:37:39,134
Thank you.

206
00:37:45,684 --> 00:37:47,709
How did things ever get so far?

207
00:37:49,221 --> 00:37:50,779
I don't know.

208
00:37:52,958 --> 00:37:56,450
It was so unfortunate
and so unnecessary.

209
00:37:59,531 --> 00:38:01,658
Tattaglia lost a son...

210
00:38:01,767 --> 00:38:03,655
and I lost a son.

211
00:38:05,003 --> 00:38:08,598
We're quits,
and if Tattaglia agrees...

212
00:38:08,707 --> 00:38:12,768
then I'm willing to let things
go on the way they were before.

213
00:38:14,413 --> 00:38:17,940
We are all grateful to Don Corleone
for calling this meeting.

214
00:38:18,050 --> 00:38:20,746
We all know him
as a man of his word.

215
00:38:20,852 --> 00:38:22,979
A modest man.
He'll always listen to reason.

216
00:38:23,088 --> 00:38:25,511
Yes, Don Barzini.

217
00:38:25,624 --> 00:38:27,580
He's too modest.

218
00:38:27,692 --> 00:38:30,650
He had all the judges
and politicians in his pocket.

219
00:38:32,064 --> 00:38:34,897
He refused to share them.

220
00:38:35,000 --> 00:38:37,992
When did I ever refuse
an accommodation?

221
00:38:38,870 --> 00:38:40,758
All of you know me here.

222
00:38:42,240 --> 00:38:46,267
When did I ever refuse,
except one time?

223
00:38:46,378 --> 00:38:47,936
And why?

224
00:38:49,047 --> 00:38:51,538
Because I believe
this drug business...

225
00:38:51,650 --> 00:38:54,778
is gonna destroy us
in the years to come.

226
00:38:54,886 --> 00:38:58,617
I mean, it's not like gambling
or liquor or even women...

227
00:38:58,723 --> 00:39:01,453
which is something that
most people want nowadays...

228
00:39:01,560 --> 00:39:05,018
and is forbidden to them by
the pezzonovante of the church.

229
00:39:05,130 --> 00:39:08,224
Even the police departments
that have helped us in the past...

230
00:39:08,333 --> 00:39:10,062
with gambling and other things...

231
00:39:10,168 --> 00:39:14,298
are gonna refuse to help us
when it comes to narcotics.

232
00:39:14,406 --> 00:39:17,330
And I believed that then...

233
00:39:17,442 --> 00:39:19,467
and I believe that now.

234
00:39:19,578 --> 00:39:21,773
Times have changed.

235
00:39:21,880 --> 00:39:24,041
It's not like the old days...

236
00:39:24,149 --> 00:39:26,572
when we could do
anything we want.

237
00:39:26,685 --> 00:39:29,574
A refusal is not the act
of a friend.

238
00:39:29,688 --> 00:39:33,613
If Don Corleone had all the judges
and politicians in New York...

239
00:39:33,725 --> 00:39:36,717
then he must share them
or let others use them.

240
00:39:36,828 --> 00:39:39,991
He must let us draw
the water from the well.

241
00:39:40,932 --> 00:39:44,493
Certainly, he can present a bill
for such services.

242
00:39:44,603 --> 00:39:47,333
After all, we are not Communists.

243
00:39:50,308 --> 00:39:53,368
I also don't believe in drugs.

244
00:39:53,478 --> 00:39:55,605
For years,
I paid my people extra...

245
00:39:55,714 --> 00:39:58,012
so they wouldn't do
that kind of business.

246
00:39:58,116 --> 00:40:01,540
Somebody comes to them and says,
"I have powders.

247
00:40:01,653 --> 00:40:04,383
If you put up a three,
four-thousand-dollar investment...

248
00:40:05,357 --> 00:40:08,019
we can make 50,000 distributing. "

249
00:40:09,127 --> 00:40:12,915
So they can't resist. I want
to control it as a business...

250
00:40:13,031 --> 00:40:15,397
to keep it respectable.

251
00:40:15,500 --> 00:40:20,028
I don't want it near schools.
I don't want it sold to children.

252
00:40:20,138 --> 00:40:21,696
That's an infamia.

253
00:40:23,175 --> 00:40:27,100
In my city, we'll keep the traffic
in the dark people, the colored.

254
00:40:27,212 --> 00:40:30,067
They're animals anyway,
so let them lose their souls.

255
00:40:37,055 --> 00:40:40,354
I hoped that we could come here
and reason together.

256
00:40:42,093 --> 00:40:45,256
As a reasonable man, I'm willing
to do whatever's necessary...

257
00:40:45,363 --> 00:40:48,855
to find a peaceful solution
to these problems.

258
00:40:48,967 --> 00:40:51,026
Then we are agreed.

259
00:40:51,136 --> 00:40:53,468
The traffic in drugs
will be permitted but controlled.

260
00:40:53,572 --> 00:40:56,132
Don Corleone will give us
protection in the east...

261
00:40:56,241 --> 00:40:58,072
and there will be the peace.

262
00:40:58,176 --> 00:41:02,033
But I must have strict assurance
from Corleone.

263
00:41:02,147 --> 00:41:05,310
As time goes by and
his position becomes stronger...

264
00:41:05,417 --> 00:41:07,942
will he attempt
any individual vendetta?

265
00:41:08,053 --> 00:41:10,009
Look, we are all
reasonable men here.

266
00:41:10,121 --> 00:41:13,545
We don't have to give assurances
as if we were lawyers.

267
00:41:13,658 --> 00:41:15,785
You talk about vengeance.

268
00:41:15,894 --> 00:41:19,159
Is vengeance gonna bring
your son back to you?

269
00:41:19,264 --> 00:41:21,289
Or my boy to me?

270
00:41:22,434 --> 00:41:24,766
I forego the vengeance of my son.

271
00:41:28,073 --> 00:41:29,961
But I have selfish reasons.

272
00:41:32,577 --> 00:41:34,499
My youngest son...

273
00:41:34,613 --> 00:41:36,604
was forced to leave this country...

274
00:41:38,116 --> 00:41:40,038
because of this Sollozzo business.

275
00:41:41,086 --> 00:41:43,919
All right.
And I have to make arrangements...

276
00:41:44,022 --> 00:41:48,652
to bring him back here safely,
cleared of all these false charges.

277
00:41:50,295 --> 00:41:53,321
But I'm a superstitious man.

278
00:41:53,431 --> 00:41:55,991
And if some unluc accident
should befall him-

279
00:41:56,101 --> 00:41:59,832
if he should get shot
in the head by a police officer...

280
00:41:59,938 --> 00:42:03,760
or if he should hang himself
in his jail cell...

281
00:42:03,875 --> 00:42:06,298
of if he’s struck
by a bolt of lightening-

282
00:42:08,013 --> 00:42:11,039
then I'm going to blame
some of the people in this room.

283
00:42:13,251 --> 00:42:15,139
And that I do not forgive.

284
00:42:18,089 --> 00:42:19,977
But that aside...

285
00:42:23,528 --> 00:42:25,450
let me say that I swear...

286
00:42:27,465 --> 00:42:30,559
on the souls
of my grandchildren...

287
00:42:30,669 --> 00:42:34,196
that I will not be the one to break
the peace we've made here today.
