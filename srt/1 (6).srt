1
00:00:46,240 --> 00:00:48,674
I believe in America.

2
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:51,833
America has made my fortune.

3
00:00:52,040 --> 00:00:55,953
And I raised my daughter
in the American fashion.

4
00:00:56,160 --> 00:01:00,870
I gave her freedom, but I taught her
never to dishonour her family.

5
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:04,958
She found a boyfriend, not an Italian.

6
00:01:05,160 --> 00:01:09,392
She went to the movies with him.
She stayed out late.

7
00:01:09,600 --> 00:01:11,955
I didn't protest.

8
00:01:12,160 --> 00:01:16,551
Two months ago he took her for a drive
with another boyfriend.

9
00:01:17,640 --> 00:01:20,154
They made her drink whiskey

10
00:01:20,360 --> 00:01:24,035
and then they tried to
take advantage of her.

11
00:01:24,240 --> 00:01:28,677
She resisted, she kept her honour.

12
00:01:29,800 --> 00:01:33,156
So they beat her like an animal.

13
00:01:34,400 --> 00:01:39,110
When I went to the hospital,
her nose was broken,

14
00:01:39,320 --> 00:01:43,916
her jaw was shattered,
held together by wire.

15
00:01:45,600 --> 00:01:49,070
She couldn't even weep
because of the pain.

16
00:01:50,800 --> 00:01:54,759
But I wept. Why did I weep?

17
00:01:56,720 --> 00:01:59,314
She was the light of my life.

18
00:02:00,920 --> 00:02:02,956
Beautiful girl.

19
00:02:06,160 --> 00:02:09,118
Now she will never be beautiful again.

20
00:02:15,240 --> 00:02:17,196
Sorry.

21
00:02:24,560 --> 00:02:28,314
I went to the police,
like a good American.

22
00:02:29,080 --> 00:02:32,436
These two boys were brought to trial.

23
00:02:32,640 --> 00:02:37,316
The judge sentenced them to three years
in prison, but suspended the sentence.

24
00:02:38,600 --> 00:02:43,958
Suspended the sentence!
They went free that very day!

25
00:02:45,600 --> 00:02:48,751
I stood in the courtroom like a fool.

26
00:02:48,960 --> 00:02:53,272
Those two bastards, they smiled at me.

27
00:02:53,480 --> 00:02:59,157
Then I said to my wife, "For justice,
we must go to Don Corleone."

28
00:03:03,920 --> 00:03:08,118
Why did you go to the police?
Why didn't you come to me first?

29
00:03:08,320 --> 00:03:13,599
What do you want of me? Tell me
anything, but do what I beg you to do.

30
00:03:14,160 --> 00:03:16,549
What is that?

31
00:03:25,520 --> 00:03:28,114
I want them dead.

32
00:03:39,400 --> 00:03:42,278
That I cannot do.

33
00:03:42,480 --> 00:03:45,756
I'll give you anything you ask.

34
00:03:46,960 --> 00:03:52,353
I've known you many years, but this
is the first time you've asked for help.

35
00:03:53,240 --> 00:03:58,519
I can't remember the last time
you invited me for a cup of coffee.

36
00:03:59,440 --> 00:04:02,989
Even though my wife is godmother
to your only child.

37
00:04:03,200 --> 00:04:07,910
But let's be frank here.
You never wanted my friendship.

38
00:04:08,120 --> 00:04:11,635
And you were afraid to be in my debt.

39
00:04:11,840 --> 00:04:14,912
I didn't want to get into trouble.

40
00:04:15,120 --> 00:04:17,156
I understand.

41
00:04:17,800 --> 00:04:20,598
You found Paradise in America.

42
00:04:22,880 --> 00:04:27,431
You made a good living, had police
protection and there were courts of law.

43
00:04:27,640 --> 00:04:30,473
You didn't need a friend like me.

44
00:04:31,720 --> 00:04:35,156
But now you come to me and say,

45
00:04:35,360 --> 00:04:38,318
"Don Corleone, give me justice."

46
00:04:39,440 --> 00:04:42,113
But you don't ask with respect.

47
00:04:42,320 --> 00:04:47,269
You don't offer friendship. You don't
even think to call me Godfather.

48
00:04:48,360 --> 00:04:54,913
You come on my daughter's wedding
day and ask me to murder for money.

49
00:04:55,120 --> 00:04:57,509
I ask you for justice.

50
00:04:57,720 --> 00:05:00,393
That is not justice.
Your daughter is alive.

51
00:05:01,320 --> 00:05:05,279
Let them suffer, then, as she suffers.

52
00:05:06,680 --> 00:05:09,513
How much shall I pay you?

53
00:05:22,960 --> 00:05:26,794
Bonasera, Bonasera.

54
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:31,755
What have I ever done to make you
treat me so disrespectfully?

55
00:05:31,960 --> 00:05:34,349
If you'd come in friendship,

56
00:05:34,560 --> 00:05:39,509
the scum that ruined your daughter
would be suffering this very day.

57
00:05:39,720 --> 00:05:45,477
And if an honest man like you should
make enemies, they'd be my enemies.

58
00:05:47,560 --> 00:05:50,358
And then they would fear you.

59
00:05:53,640 --> 00:05:56,029
Be my friend?

60
00:05:59,360 --> 00:06:02,193
Godfather?

61
00:06:05,120 --> 00:06:06,792
Good.

62
00:06:08,320 --> 00:06:13,519
Some day, and that day may never
come, I'll ask a service of you.

63
00:06:14,520 --> 00:06:17,273
But until that day...

64
00:06:18,160 --> 00:06:22,358
...accept this justice as a gift
on my daughter's wedding day.

65
00:06:22,560 --> 00:06:25,233
- <i>Grazie,</i> Godfather.
- <i>Prego.</i>

66
00:06:30,960 --> 00:06:34,669
Give this to Clemenza.

67
00:06:36,400 --> 00:06:39,756
I want people that aren't going to
get carried away.

68
00:06:39,960 --> 00:06:43,839
We're not murderers,
in spite of what this undertaker says.

69
00:07:08,080 --> 00:07:11,197
- Where's Michael?
- Don't worry, he'll be here.

70
00:07:12,400 --> 00:07:15,233
We're not taking the picture
without Michael.

71
00:07:21,440 --> 00:07:24,193
- What's the matter?
- It's Michael.

72
00:08:11,440 --> 00:08:13,396
Don Barzini.

73
00:08:28,920 --> 00:08:31,957
Hey, Paulie! Let me have some wine.

74
00:08:32,160 --> 00:08:34,549
Paulie! More wine.

75
00:08:34,760 --> 00:08:39,276
- You look terrific on the floor.
- Are you a dance judge or something?

76
00:08:41,120 --> 00:08:43,236
Take a walk and do your job.

77
00:08:50,640 --> 00:08:53,677
Sandra, watch the kids.
Don't let them run wild.

78
00:08:53,880 --> 00:08:56,633
You watch yourself, all right?

79
00:09:16,680 --> 00:09:20,639
<i>2</i>0, 30 grand. In small bills, cash.

80
00:09:21,600 --> 00:09:23,591
In that little silk purse.

81
00:09:23,800 --> 00:09:27,236
If this were somebody else's wedding...
<i>Sfortunato!</i>

82
00:09:27,440 --> 00:09:28,714
Hey, Paulie!

83
00:09:32,400 --> 00:09:33,674
Stupid jerk!

84
00:09:42,200 --> 00:09:44,156
What's the matter?

85
00:09:55,920 --> 00:09:58,115
- Have to go back to work.
- Tom.

86
00:09:58,320 --> 00:10:02,871
No Sicilian can refuse any request
on his daughter's wedding day.

87
00:10:07,840 --> 00:10:13,153
Don Corleone, I'm honoured and
grateful that you have invited me.

88
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:20,913
Get out of here!
It's a private party. Go on!

89
00:10:21,480 --> 00:10:24,438
What is it? It's my sister's wedding.

90
00:10:30,560 --> 00:10:33,836
Goddamn FBI don't respect nothing!

91
00:10:36,160 --> 00:10:38,913
Come here, come here, come here!

92
00:10:52,960 --> 00:10:57,476
...but towards the end, he was paroled
to help with the American war effort,

93
00:10:57,680 --> 00:11:00,433
so for six months he's worked
in my pastry shop.

94
00:11:00,640 --> 00:11:02,710
Nazorine, what can I do for you?

95
00:11:02,920 --> 00:11:04,990
Now that the war is over,

96
00:11:05,200 --> 00:11:09,159
this boy, Enzo, they want to
repatriate him back to Italy.

97
00:11:09,360 --> 00:11:14,354
Godfather, I have a daughter.
You see, she and Enzo...

98
00:11:15,160 --> 00:11:20,439
You want Enzo to stay in this country,
and your daughter to be married.

99
00:11:20,640 --> 00:11:22,710
You understand everything.

100
00:11:23,560 --> 00:11:26,074
Mr Hagen. Thank you.

101
00:11:28,920 --> 00:11:32,708
Wait till you see the wedding cake
I made for your daughter!

102
00:11:32,920 --> 00:11:35,639
The bride, the groom and the angel...

103
00:11:40,280 --> 00:11:44,558
- Who should I give this job to?
- Not to our <i>paisà.</i>

104
00:11:44,760 --> 00:11:49,880
Give it to a Jew Congressman in
another district. Who else is on the list?

105
00:11:56,400 --> 00:11:58,516
Hey, Michael!

106
00:12:16,680 --> 00:12:20,832
He's not on the list,
but Luca Brasi wants to see you.

107
00:12:25,800 --> 00:12:28,155
Is this necessary?

108
00:12:28,360 --> 00:12:33,195
He didn't expect to be invited to the
wedding, so he wanted to thank you.

109
00:12:33,840 --> 00:12:39,198
Don Corleone, I'm honoured and
grateful that you have invited me

110
00:12:39,400 --> 00:12:44,599
on the wedding day of your daughter.
May their first child be a masculine child.

111
00:12:45,520 --> 00:12:48,353
Michael...

112
00:12:48,560 --> 00:12:51,791
That man over there
is talking to himself.

113
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:54,719
See that scary guy over there?

114
00:12:54,920 --> 00:12:57,753
- He's a very scary guy.
- What's his name?

115
00:12:57,960 --> 00:13:02,670
His name is Luca Brasi.
He helps my father out sometimes.

116
00:13:04,400 --> 00:13:07,198
Michael, he's coming over here!

117
00:13:11,240 --> 00:13:12,992
You look terrific!

118
00:13:13,200 --> 00:13:16,397
My brother Tom Hagen,
Miss Kay Adams.

119
00:13:17,800 --> 00:13:20,109
Your father's been asking for you.

120
00:13:20,320 --> 00:13:23,198
- Very nice to meet you.
- Nice to meet you.

121
00:13:24,480 --> 00:13:27,313
Why does your brother
have a different name?

122
00:13:27,520 --> 00:13:30,910
My brother Sonny found Tom Hagen
in the street.

123
00:13:31,120 --> 00:13:35,193
He had no home,
so my father took him in.

124
00:13:36,560 --> 00:13:39,393
He's been with us ever since.

125
00:13:39,640 --> 00:13:42,074
He's a good lawyer.

126
00:13:42,280 --> 00:13:46,637
Not a Sicilian. I think he's
going to be <i>consigliere.</i>

127
00:13:46,840 --> 00:13:49,513
- What's that?
- That's a...

128
00:13:49,720 --> 00:13:53,998
...like a counsellor, an advisor.
Very important for the family.

129
00:13:54,200 --> 00:13:56,350
You like your lasagne?

130
00:14:00,480 --> 00:14:02,596
Don Corleone.

131
00:14:02,800 --> 00:14:05,075
I'm honoured and grateful

132
00:14:05,280 --> 00:14:09,239
that you have invited me
to your daughter's wedding.

133
00:14:13,680 --> 00:14:16,831
On the day of your daughter's wedding.

134
00:14:17,040 --> 00:14:22,160
And I hope that their first child
will be a masculine child.

135
00:14:22,920 --> 00:14:28,438
I pledge my ever-ending loyalty.

136
00:14:29,560 --> 00:14:34,634
- For your daughter's bridal purse.
- Thank you, Luca. Most valued friend.

137
00:14:34,840 --> 00:14:40,039
Don Corleone, I'm going to leave you
now, because I know you're busy.

138
00:14:40,440 --> 00:14:42,192
Thank you.

139
00:15:29,560 --> 00:15:31,596
<i>Signora</i> Corleone!

140
00:15:32,720 --> 00:15:34,472
No!

141
00:16:41,640 --> 00:16:46,316
Senator Cauley apologised for not
coming, but said you'd understand.

142
00:16:46,520 --> 00:16:50,718
Also some of the judges.
They've all sent gifts.

143
00:16:53,480 --> 00:16:54,913
What is that outside?

144
00:17:03,600 --> 00:17:06,558
Johnny! Johnny!

145
00:17:08,720 --> 00:17:10,676
I love you!

146
00:17:20,160 --> 00:17:23,550
He came all the way from California.
I told you he'd come!

147
00:17:23,760 --> 00:17:27,912
- He's probably in trouble again.
- He's a good godson.

148
00:17:28,120 --> 00:17:32,636
Johnny, Johnny! Sing a song!

149
00:17:47,280 --> 00:17:49,794
You never said you knew
Johnny Fontane!

150
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:53,834
- Sure. You want to meet him?
- Great! Sure.

151
00:17:54,040 --> 00:17:57,749
- My father helped him with his career.
- He did?

152
00:17:57,960 --> 00:17:59,916
How?

153
00:18:00,680 --> 00:18:03,831
- Let's listen to this song.
- Michael...

154
00:18:35,760 --> 00:18:37,910
Please, Michael. Tell me.

155
00:18:41,480 --> 00:18:46,190
When Johnny was starting out, he was
signed to a personal service contract

156
00:18:46,400 --> 00:18:48,868
with a big bandleader.

157
00:18:49,080 --> 00:18:54,029
And as his career got better and better,
he wanted to get out of it.

158
00:18:54,240 --> 00:18:56,708
Johnny is my father's godson.

159
00:18:56,920 --> 00:18:59,992
My father went to see this bandleader.

160
00:19:00,200 --> 00:19:03,795
He offered him 10,000 dollars
to let Johnny go,

161
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:06,389
but the bandleader said no.

162
00:19:06,600 --> 00:19:11,913
So the next day my father went to see
him, but this time with Luca Brasi.

163
00:19:13,600 --> 00:19:15,591
Within an hour,

164
00:19:15,800 --> 00:19:21,432
he signed a release
for a certified cheque of 1,000 dollars.

165
00:19:22,680 --> 00:19:26,639
- How did he do that?
- Made him an offer he couldn't refuse.

166
00:19:28,080 --> 00:19:32,676
- What was that?
- Luca Brasi held a gun to his head,

167
00:19:32,920 --> 00:19:37,948
and father said that either his brains or
his signature would be on the contract.

168
00:19:42,800 --> 00:19:44,631
That's a true story.

169
00:19:55,480 --> 00:19:58,472
That's my family, Kay. It's not me.

170
00:20:09,880 --> 00:20:11,836
Beautiful!

171
00:20:42,480 --> 00:20:44,436
I'll take care of it.

172
00:20:44,720 --> 00:20:46,199
Tom...

173
00:20:46,440 --> 00:20:50,399
I want you to find Santino.
Tell him to come to the office.

174
00:20:56,880 --> 00:20:58,836
How are you, Fredo?

175
00:20:59,040 --> 00:21:02,396
My brother Fredo,
this is Kay Adams.

176
00:21:03,400 --> 00:21:05,789
- Hi.
- How are you doing?

177
00:21:07,560 --> 00:21:10,677
- This is my brother Mike.
- Are you having a good time?

178
00:21:10,880 --> 00:21:13,838
Yeah. This is your friend?

179
00:21:14,560 --> 00:21:19,634
I don't know what to do.
My voice is weak. It's weak.

180
00:21:20,480 --> 00:21:26,510
Anyway, if I had this part in the picture,
it puts me right back on top again.

181
00:21:26,720 --> 00:21:31,874
But this... man won't give it to me,
the head of the studio.

182
00:21:32,080 --> 00:21:35,072
- What's his name?
- Woltz.

183
00:21:35,320 --> 00:21:39,552
He won't give it to me,
and he says there's no chance.

184
00:21:43,080 --> 00:21:45,036
Sonny?

185
00:21:45,960 --> 00:21:47,234
Sonny?

186
00:21:53,360 --> 00:21:55,191
Sonny?

187
00:21:55,400 --> 00:21:58,073
- Sonny, are you in there?
- What?

188
00:21:58,280 --> 00:21:59,679
The old man wants you.

189
00:22:01,080 --> 00:22:02,911
One minute.

190
00:22:16,480 --> 00:22:21,270
A month ago he bought the movie rights
to this book, a best-seller.

191
00:22:21,480 --> 00:22:24,711
The main character
is a guy just like me.

192
00:22:24,920 --> 00:22:27,639
I wouldn't even have to act.

193
00:22:27,840 --> 00:22:31,435
Godfather, I don't know what to do.

194
00:22:32,440 --> 00:22:36,513
You can act like a man!
What's the matter with you?

195
00:22:36,720 --> 00:22:41,919
Is this how you turned out a Hollywood
<i>finocchio,</i> that cries like a woman?

196
00:22:42,120 --> 00:22:46,113
"What can I do? What can I do?"
What is that nonsense?

197
00:22:46,320 --> 00:22:47,992
Ridiculous.

198
00:22:52,120 --> 00:22:55,317
- You spend time with your family?
- Sure I do.

199
00:22:55,520 --> 00:22:56,953
Good.

200
00:22:57,160 --> 00:23:02,109
Because a man who doesn't spend time
with his family can never be a real man.

201
00:23:06,800 --> 00:23:10,156
You look terrible. I want you to eat.

202
00:23:10,360 --> 00:23:15,354
Rest, and in a month this Hollywood
big shot will give you what you want.

203
00:23:15,560 --> 00:23:18,518
It's too late, they start shooting
in a week.

204
00:23:18,720 --> 00:23:21,871
I'm going to make him an offer
he can't refuse.

205
00:23:24,360 --> 00:23:29,718
Just go outside and enjoy yourself,
and forget about all this nonsense.

206
00:23:31,400 --> 00:23:34,358
- I want you to leave it all to me.
- All right.

207
00:23:58,280 --> 00:24:03,229
- What time does my daughter leave?
- Soon, after they cut the cake.

208
00:24:03,440 --> 00:24:06,830
Do we give your son-in-law
something important?

209
00:24:07,040 --> 00:24:12,114
Never. Give him a living, but never
discuss the family business with him.

210
00:24:12,320 --> 00:24:14,754
- What else?
- Virgil Sollozzo called.

211
00:24:14,960 --> 00:24:19,351
- We'll have to see him next week.
- When you come back from California.

212
00:24:20,400 --> 00:24:23,358
- When am I going to California?
- Tonight.

213
00:24:23,560 --> 00:24:28,998
I want you to talk to this movie big shot
and settle this business for Johnny.

214
00:24:30,000 --> 00:24:34,471
If there's nothing else, I'd like to go
to my daughter's wedding.

215
00:24:36,000 --> 00:24:38,958
Carlo, we're going to take the picture.

216
00:24:39,920 --> 00:24:41,717
Wait a minute.

217
00:24:41,920 --> 00:24:44,388
No, Michael. Not me.

218
00:24:46,920 --> 00:24:50,754
Okay, that's it. Just like that. Hold it!

219
00:26:36,640 --> 00:26:40,315
- You need a little more heat on that arc.
- Start talking.

220
00:26:40,520 --> 00:26:43,159
I was sent by a friend
of Johnny Fontane.

221
00:26:43,360 --> 00:26:46,670
This friend would give
his friendship to Mr Woltz,

222
00:26:46,880 --> 00:26:49,394
if Mr Woltz would grant us a favour.

223
00:26:49,600 --> 00:26:51,750
Woltz is listening.

224
00:26:51,960 --> 00:26:55,919
Give Johnny the part in that war film
you're starting next week.

225
00:27:01,240 --> 00:27:05,995
And what favour would your friend
grant Mr Woltz?

226
00:27:06,200 --> 00:27:09,476
He could make your future union
problems disappear.

227
00:27:09,680 --> 00:27:13,434
And one of your stars has just moved
from marijuana to heroin.

228
00:27:13,640 --> 00:27:17,633
Are you trying to muscle me?
Listen, you son-of-a-bitch!

229
00:27:17,840 --> 00:27:22,277
Let me lay it on the line. Johnny
Fontane will never get that movie!

230
00:27:22,480 --> 00:27:26,678
No matter how many Dago Guinea
greaseballs come out of the woodwork!

231
00:27:26,880 --> 00:27:30,475
- I'm German-Irish.
- Listen here, my Kraut-Mick friend.

232
00:27:30,680 --> 00:27:34,878
- I'm going to make trouble for you!
- I'm a lawyer. I haven't threatened...

233
00:27:35,080 --> 00:27:38,038
I know New York's big lawyers.
Who are you?

234
00:27:38,240 --> 00:27:43,553
I have a special practice. I handle
one client. I'll wait for your call.

235
00:27:45,200 --> 00:27:48,397
By the way, I admire your pictures
very much.

236
00:27:52,640 --> 00:27:54,710
Check him out.

237
00:28:15,520 --> 00:28:18,080
- It's really beautiful.
- Look at this.

238
00:28:18,280 --> 00:28:22,558
- It used to decorate a king's palace.
- Very nice.

239
00:28:22,760 --> 00:28:25,320
Why didn't you say
you work for Corleone?

240
00:28:25,520 --> 00:28:29,433
I thought you were some cheap hustler
Johnny was running in.

241
00:28:29,640 --> 00:28:32,438
- I only use his name when necessary.
- How's your drink?

242
00:28:32,640 --> 00:28:35,677
- Fine.
- Now I'll show you something beautiful.

243
00:28:35,880 --> 00:28:38,553
You do appreciate beauty, don't you?

244
00:28:41,240 --> 00:28:44,198
There you are.
600,000 dollars on four hoofs.

245
00:28:44,400 --> 00:28:47,949
I bet Russian czars never paid
that for a single horse.

246
00:28:48,160 --> 00:28:50,151
Khartoum.

247
00:28:50,360 --> 00:28:52,032
Khartoum.

248
00:28:52,800 --> 00:28:57,510
I'm not going to race him, though.
I'm going to put him out to stud.

249
00:28:58,640 --> 00:29:00,119
Thanks, Tony.

250
00:29:00,320 --> 00:29:03,357
Let's get something to eat.

251
00:29:03,560 --> 00:29:06,870
Corleone is Johnny's godfather.

252
00:29:07,080 --> 00:29:11,198
To the Italian people that's
a very sacred, close relationship.

253
00:29:11,400 --> 00:29:16,793
I respect it. Tell him to ask me anything
else. This favour I can't give him.

254
00:29:17,000 --> 00:29:20,675
He never asks a second favour
when he's been refused the first.

255
00:29:20,880 --> 00:29:25,829
You don't understand. Johnny Fontane
never gets that movie.

256
00:29:26,800 --> 00:29:30,475
That part is perfect for him.
It'll make him a big star.

257
00:29:30,680 --> 00:29:34,958
I'm going to run him out of the business,
and let me tell you why.

258
00:29:36,200 --> 00:29:40,830
Johnny Fontane ruined one of Woltz
International's most valuable protégés.

259
00:29:41,040 --> 00:29:45,989
We trained her for five years.
Singing, acting, dancing lessons.

260
00:29:46,200 --> 00:29:50,591
I spent hundreds of thousands of dollars
on her, to make her a big star.

261
00:29:50,800 --> 00:29:53,234
Let me be even more frank.

262
00:29:53,440 --> 00:29:58,116
To show you that I'm not a hard-hearted
man. That it's not all dollars and cents.

263
00:29:58,320 --> 00:30:01,710
She was beautiful.
She was young and innocent!

264
00:30:01,920 --> 00:30:06,869
She's the greatest piece of ass I've had
and I've had them all over the world.

265
00:30:07,080 --> 00:30:12,950
Then Johnny Fontane comes along with
his olive oil voice and Guinea charm.

266
00:30:13,160 --> 00:30:15,628
And she runs off.

267
00:30:15,840 --> 00:30:19,116
She threw it all away
just to make me look ridiculous!

268
00:30:19,840 --> 00:30:24,960
And a man in my position can't afford
to be made to look ridiculous!

269
00:30:25,160 --> 00:30:27,310
You get the hell out of here!

270
00:30:27,520 --> 00:30:31,752
If that goombah tries any rough stuff,
tell him I'm no bandleader.

271
00:30:32,680 --> 00:30:35,831
Yeah, I heard that story.

272
00:30:36,520 --> 00:30:40,149
Thank you for dinner
and a very pleasant evening.

273
00:30:40,360 --> 00:30:42,828
Maybe your car can take me
to the airport.

274
00:30:43,040 --> 00:30:46,919
Mr Corleone insists on hearing
bad news immediately.

275
00:32:34,640 --> 00:32:38,474
- You're not too tired, are you, Tom?
- No, I slept on the plane.

276
00:32:38,680 --> 00:32:41,478
I have the Sollozzo notes here.

277
00:32:41,680 --> 00:32:43,750
Now...

278
00:32:44,640 --> 00:32:49,760
Sollozzo is known as The Turk. He's
supposed to be very good with a knife,

279
00:32:50,400 --> 00:32:54,359
<i>but only in matters of business</i>
<i>with reasonable complaint.</i>

280
00:32:54,560 --> 00:32:57,518
<i>His business is narcotics.</i>

281
00:32:57,720 --> 00:33:00,712
<i>He has fields in Turkey,</i>
<i>where they grow poppy.</i>

282
00:33:00,920 --> 00:33:04,674
<i>In Sicily he has plants to process them</i>
<i>into heroin.</i>

283
00:33:04,880 --> 00:33:08,316
<i>He needs cash, he needs protection</i>
<i>from the police.</i>

284
00:33:08,520 --> 00:33:12,035
<i>He'll give a piece of the action.</i>
<i>I don't know how much.</i>

285
00:33:12,240 --> 00:33:18,190
<i>The Tattaglia family is behind him here.</i>
<i>They have to be in it for something.</i>

286
00:33:18,400 --> 00:33:22,678
- What about his prison record?
- One term in Italy, one here.

287
00:33:22,880 --> 00:33:25,348
He's known as a top narcotics man.

288
00:33:25,560 --> 00:33:30,759
- Santino, what do you think?
- A lot of money in that white powder.

289
00:33:32,320 --> 00:33:33,673
Tom?

290
00:33:33,880 --> 00:33:37,634
<i>Yes. There's more money in narcotics</i>
<i>than anything else.</i>

291
00:33:37,840 --> 00:33:42,231
<i>If we don't get into it, somebody else</i>
<i>will, maybe the five families.</i>

292
00:33:42,440 --> 00:33:46,672
With that money they can buy
more police and political power.

293
00:33:46,880 --> 00:33:48,836
Then they come after us.

294
00:33:49,040 --> 00:33:54,831
Now we have unions and gambling, and
that's great, but narcotics is the future.

295
00:33:55,040 --> 00:34:00,512
If we don't get a piece of that action,
we risk everything in ten years' time.

296
00:34:04,400 --> 00:34:07,551
So? What's your answer
going to be, Pop?

297
00:34:12,080 --> 00:34:14,355
Don Corleone.

298
00:34:15,720 --> 00:34:18,871
I need a man who has powerful friends.

299
00:34:19,080 --> 00:34:21,514
I need a million dollars in cash.

300
00:34:21,720 --> 00:34:27,431
I need those politicians that you carry
in your pocket, like nickels and dimes.

301
00:34:28,600 --> 00:34:32,434
- What is the interest for my family?
- 30 per cent.

302
00:34:32,640 --> 00:34:36,599
In the first year your end should be
three, four million dollars.

303
00:34:36,800 --> 00:34:39,394
And then it would go up.

304
00:34:39,600 --> 00:34:43,036
And what is the interest
for the Tattaglia family?

305
00:34:44,720 --> 00:34:47,029
My compliments.

306
00:34:49,960 --> 00:34:52,633
I'll take care of them, out of my share.

307
00:34:52,840 --> 00:34:57,391
So I receive 30 per cent for finance,

308
00:34:57,600 --> 00:35:00,751
political influence and legal protection?

309
00:35:00,960 --> 00:35:03,520
That's right.

310
00:35:03,720 --> 00:35:07,349
Why do you come to me?
Why do I deserve this generosity?

311
00:35:07,560 --> 00:35:12,509
If you consider a million dollars in cash
just finance,

312
00:35:12,720 --> 00:35:15,393
<i>ti saluto,</i> Don Corleone.

313
00:35:24,680 --> 00:35:29,708
I said that I would see you, because
I heard you were a serious man,

314
00:35:29,920 --> 00:35:32,115
to be treated with respect.

315
00:35:36,600 --> 00:35:39,990
But, I must say no to you.

316
00:35:40,880 --> 00:35:43,394
And I'll give you my reason.

317
00:35:43,600 --> 00:35:47,479
It's true, I have a lot of friends in politics.

318
00:35:47,680 --> 00:35:52,117
They wouldn't be friendly long if I was
involved in drugs instead of gambling,

319
00:35:52,320 --> 00:35:57,553
which they regard as a harmless vice,
but drugs is a dirty business.

320
00:35:57,760 --> 00:36:02,151
It doesn't make any difference to me
what a man does for a living.

321
00:36:02,360 --> 00:36:07,388
But your business is...
a little dangerous.

322
00:36:07,600 --> 00:36:11,479
If you're worried about security,
the Tattaglias will guarantee it.

323
00:36:11,680 --> 00:36:15,639
- The Tattaglias would guarantee our...
- Wait a minute.

324
00:36:21,800 --> 00:36:26,476
I have a sentimental weakness
for my children, and I spoil them.

325
00:36:26,680 --> 00:36:30,229
They talk when they should listen.
But anyway...

326
00:36:30,440 --> 00:36:35,389
Signor Sollozzo, my no is final. I wish to
congratulate you on your new business.

327
00:36:35,600 --> 00:36:38,478
I know you'll do well, and good luck.

328
00:36:38,680 --> 00:36:43,629
Especially since your interests
don't conflict with mine. Thank you.

329
00:37:03,120 --> 00:37:04,951
Santino.

330
00:37:05,160 --> 00:37:06,513
Come here.

331
00:37:08,880 --> 00:37:15,353
What's the matter with you? Your brain
is going soft from playing with that girl.

332
00:37:15,560 --> 00:37:19,917
Never tell anybody outside the family
what you're thinking again.

333
00:37:20,600 --> 00:37:22,591
Go on.

334
00:37:25,640 --> 00:37:28,438
Tom, what's this nonsense?

335
00:37:28,640 --> 00:37:32,315
It's from Johnny.
He's starring in that new film.

336
00:37:33,880 --> 00:37:36,838
- Take it away.
- Take it over there.

337
00:37:37,840 --> 00:37:39,398
And...

338
00:37:40,200 --> 00:37:42,839
...tell Luca Brasi to come in.

339
00:37:48,120 --> 00:37:51,396
I'm a little worried
about this Sollozzo fellow.

340
00:37:51,600 --> 00:37:54,239
Find out what he's got
under his fingernails.

341
00:37:55,320 --> 00:37:57,880
Go to the Tattaglias.

342
00:37:58,840 --> 00:38:04,039
Make them think that you're not
too happy with our family

343
00:38:04,240 --> 00:38:07,198
and find out what you can.

344
00:38:23,240 --> 00:38:26,391
I got something for your mother
and for Sonny

345
00:38:26,600 --> 00:38:31,071
and a tie for Freddy,
and Tom Hagen got the Reynolds pen.

346
00:38:31,280 --> 00:38:35,239
- What do you want for Christmas?
- Just you.

347
00:39:04,720 --> 00:39:06,597
<i>Andiamo,</i> Fredo.

348
00:39:06,800 --> 00:39:10,076
- Tell Paulie to get the car.
- Okay, Pop.

349
00:39:10,280 --> 00:39:14,239
I'll have to get it myself.
Paulie called in sick this morning.

350
00:39:15,600 --> 00:39:19,070
Paulie's a good kid.
I don't mind getting the car.

351
00:39:22,080 --> 00:39:24,071
<i>Buon Natale, caro. Grazie.</i>

352
00:40:05,000 --> 00:40:09,198
- Luca! I'm Bruno Tattaglia.
- I know.

353
00:40:18,480 --> 00:40:19,754
You know who I am?

354
00:40:19,960 --> 00:40:21,109
I know you.

355
00:40:21,880 --> 00:40:25,316
You have been talking to the
Tattaglia family... right?

356
00:40:26,440 --> 00:40:31,116
I think you and I can do business.

357
00:40:32,680 --> 00:40:35,069
I need someone strong like you.

358
00:40:35,280 --> 00:40:38,636
I heard you are not happy...

359
00:40:38,840 --> 00:40:40,956
...with the Corleone family.

360
00:40:41,160 --> 00:40:44,550
Want to join me?

361
00:40:44,760 --> 00:40:46,955
What's in it for me?

362
00:40:47,160 --> 00:40:50,835
$50,000 to start with.

363
00:40:53,960 --> 00:40:56,155
Not bad!

364
00:40:56,360 --> 00:40:58,316
Agreed?

365
00:41:54,680 --> 00:41:57,752
Tom! Tom Hagen. Merry Christmas.

366
00:41:58,520 --> 00:42:02,991
- Glad to see you. I want to talk to you.
- I haven't got time.

367
00:42:03,200 --> 00:42:06,909
Make time, <i>Consigliere.</i> Get in the car.

368
00:42:07,880 --> 00:42:12,351
What are you worried about? If I wanted
to kill you, you'd be dead already.

369
00:42:12,560 --> 00:42:14,118
Get in.

370
00:42:24,640 --> 00:42:28,428
- Fredo, I'm going to buy some fruit.
- Okay, Pop.

371
00:42:34,080 --> 00:42:37,277
Merry Christmas. I want some fruit.

372
00:44:00,880 --> 00:44:05,192
Would you like me better
if I were a nun? Like in the story.

373
00:44:07,840 --> 00:44:09,114
No.

374
00:44:09,320 --> 00:44:13,632
- What if I were Ingrid Bergman?
- Now, that's a thought.

375
00:44:15,520 --> 00:44:17,238
Michael.

376
00:44:17,440 --> 00:44:22,355
No, I wouldn't like you better if you were
Ingrid Bergman. What's the matter?

377
00:44:37,840 --> 00:44:40,354
They don't say if he's dead or alive.

378
00:45:01,720 --> 00:45:04,837
- Sonny, it's Michael.
- <i>Where have you been?</i>

379
00:45:05,040 --> 00:45:07,554
- Is he all right?
- <i>We don't know yet.</i>

380
00:45:07,760 --> 00:45:12,231
<i>There are all kinds of stories.</i>
<i>He was hit bad, Mikey.</i>

381
00:45:13,400 --> 00:45:16,437
- <i>Are you there?</i>
- Yeah, I'm here.

382
00:45:16,640 --> 00:45:20,838
- <i>Where have you been? I was worried.</i>
- Didn't Tom tell you I called?

383
00:45:21,040 --> 00:45:25,556
<i>No. Look, come home, kid.</i>
<i>You should be with Mama, you hear?</i>

384
00:45:32,480 --> 00:45:34,596
Oh, my God.

385
00:45:37,920 --> 00:45:39,512
Sonny!

386
00:45:47,720 --> 00:45:49,836
Stay back there.

387
00:45:50,040 --> 00:45:53,077
- Who is it?
- Open up, it's Clemenza.

388
00:45:54,880 --> 00:45:57,872
There's more news about your old man.

389
00:45:58,080 --> 00:46:00,674
Word is out that he's already dead.

390
00:46:00,880 --> 00:46:04,350
- What's the matter with you?
- Take it easy!

391
00:46:04,560 --> 00:46:07,632
- Where was Paulie?
- Sick. He's been sick all winter.

392
00:46:07,840 --> 00:46:10,274
- How often?
- Only three, four times.

393
00:46:10,480 --> 00:46:14,029
- Freddy didn't want a new bodyguard.
- Pick him up now.

394
00:46:14,240 --> 00:46:18,472
I don't care how sick he is. Bring him
to my father's house right now.

395
00:46:18,680 --> 00:46:22,275
- You want anyone sent over here?
- No. Go ahead.

396
00:46:28,760 --> 00:46:32,833
I'm going to have a couple of our people
come over to the house.

397
00:46:36,840 --> 00:46:39,035
- Hello?
- <i>Santino Corleone?</i>

398
00:46:39,240 --> 00:46:41,959
- Yeah.
- <i>We have Tom Hagen.</i>

399
00:46:42,160 --> 00:46:45,391
<i>In three hours he'll be released</i>
<i>with our proposition.</i>

400
00:46:45,600 --> 00:46:48,717
<i>Listen to what he has to say</i>
<i>before you do anything.</i>

401
00:46:48,920 --> 00:46:53,311
<i>What's done is done. Don't lose that</i>
<i>famous temper of yours, Sonny.</i>

402
00:46:53,520 --> 00:46:55,590
I'll wait.

403
00:47:08,720 --> 00:47:11,393
Your boss is dead.

404
00:47:13,400 --> 00:47:18,349
I know you're not in the muscle end
of the family, so don't be scared.

405
00:47:18,560 --> 00:47:23,588
I want you to help the Corleones
and me.

406
00:47:26,160 --> 00:47:30,711
We got him outside his office
about an hour after we picked you up.

407
00:47:32,000 --> 00:47:33,399
Drink it.

408
00:47:37,600 --> 00:47:40,910
It's up to you to make peace
between me and Sonny.

409
00:47:45,120 --> 00:47:48,908
Sonny was hot for my deal, wasn't he?

410
00:47:49,120 --> 00:47:52,669
And you knew
it was the right thing to do.

411
00:47:52,880 --> 00:47:58,238
- Sonny will come after you.
- That will be his first reaction, sure.

412
00:47:59,160 --> 00:48:04,837
So you have to talk sense into him.
The Tattaglia family is behind me.

413
00:48:05,440 --> 00:48:10,389
The other New York families will go
along with anything to prevent war.

414
00:48:10,600 --> 00:48:15,958
Let's face it, with all due respect,
the Don - rest in peace - was slipping.

415
00:48:18,320 --> 00:48:21,756
Ten years ago,
could I have gotten to him?

416
00:48:24,920 --> 00:48:29,471
Well, now he's dead, Tom,
and nothing can bring him back.

417
00:48:30,400 --> 00:48:36,555
You've got to talk to Sonny, to the
Caporegimes, Tessio, fat Clemenza.

418
00:48:40,760 --> 00:48:44,036
It's good business, Tom.

419
00:48:44,240 --> 00:48:49,234
I'll try. But even Sonny won't be able
to call off Luca Brasi.

420
00:48:51,760 --> 00:48:53,876
Yeah, well...

421
00:48:55,160 --> 00:48:57,720
Let me worry about Luca.

422
00:49:02,440 --> 00:49:04,431
You just talk to Sonny.

423
00:49:04,640 --> 00:49:07,359
And the other two kids.

424
00:49:09,840 --> 00:49:12,912
- I'll do my best.
- Good.

425
00:49:14,520 --> 00:49:17,353
Now you can go.

426
00:49:23,480 --> 00:49:27,189
I don't like violence, Tom.
I'm a businessman.

427
00:49:28,080 --> 00:49:31,038
Blood is a big expense.

428
00:49:50,600 --> 00:49:52,556
He's still alive.

429
00:49:52,760 --> 00:49:56,309
They hit him with five shots,
and he's still alive!

430
00:49:56,520 --> 00:50:01,469
That's bad luck for me, and bad luck
for you if you don't make that deal.

431
00:50:43,720 --> 00:50:48,510
Your mother is at the hospital with
your father. Looks like he'll pull through.

432
00:50:50,280 --> 00:50:56,469
It's a lot of bad blood. Sollozzo, Philip
Tattaglia, Bruno Tattaglia, Ramon...

433
00:50:56,720 --> 00:50:59,473
- You gonna kill all those guys?
- Stay out of it.

434
00:50:59,680 --> 00:51:02,513
If you get rid of Sollozzo,
everything falls into line.

435
00:51:02,720 --> 00:51:05,871
What about Luca?
Sollozzo thinks he can control him.

436
00:51:06,600 --> 00:51:10,309
If Luca sold out, we're in a lot of trouble.

437
00:51:10,520 --> 00:51:14,115
- Has anyone been in touch with Luca?
- We've been trying all night.

438
00:51:14,320 --> 00:51:18,871
- Hey, do me a favour...
- Luca never sleeps over with a broad.

439
00:51:19,840 --> 00:51:25,756
Well, Tom, you're <i>consigliere.</i>
What do we do if the old man dies?

440
00:51:25,960 --> 00:51:31,956
If we lose the old man, we lose the
political contacts and half our strength.

441
00:51:32,160 --> 00:51:37,188
The other New York families might
support Sollozzo to avoid a long war.

442
00:51:37,400 --> 00:51:41,712
This is almost 1946.
Nobody wants bloodshed anymore.

443
00:51:41,920 --> 00:51:43,558
If your father dies...

444
00:51:45,680 --> 00:51:47,352
...you make the deal.

445
00:51:47,560 --> 00:51:52,076
- Easy to say. He's not your father.
- I'm as much a son as you or Mike.

446
00:51:56,440 --> 00:51:58,715
What is it?

447
00:51:58,920 --> 00:52:03,869
- Paulie, I told you to stay put.
- The guy at the gates has a package.

448
00:52:04,080 --> 00:52:07,231
Tessio, go see what it is.

449
00:52:09,800 --> 00:52:11,950
- Shall I stay?
- Yeah. Are you all right?

450
00:52:12,160 --> 00:52:15,675
- I'm fine.
- There's food. Are you hungry?

451
00:52:15,880 --> 00:52:19,190
- No.
- A drink? Brandy will sweat it out.

452
00:52:19,400 --> 00:52:21,960
- Go ahead.
- That might be a good idea.

453
00:52:23,480 --> 00:52:28,315
Take care of that son-of-a-bitch.
Paulie sold out the old man.

454
00:52:28,520 --> 00:52:32,672
- Make that the first thing on your list.
- Understood.

455
00:52:32,880 --> 00:52:37,032
Mickey, tomorrow, get some guys
and go to Luca's apartment.

456
00:52:37,240 --> 00:52:41,028
Maybe we shouldn't get Mike
mixed up in this too directly.

457
00:52:42,920 --> 00:52:46,629
Hanging around the house on
the phone would be a big help.

458
00:52:47,280 --> 00:52:49,475
Try Luca again.

459
00:52:57,800 --> 00:53:00,473
- What's this?
- A Sicilian message.

460
00:53:00,680 --> 00:53:04,309
It means Luca Brasi
sleeps with the fishes.

461
00:53:16,640 --> 00:53:18,790
- I'm going.
- When will you be home?

462
00:53:19,000 --> 00:53:21,195
Probably late.

463
00:53:22,600 --> 00:53:26,195
- Don't forget the <i>cannoli!</i>
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.

464
00:53:28,280 --> 00:53:32,717
Rocco, sit on the other side.
You block the rear-view mirror.

465
00:53:33,960 --> 00:53:37,555
Sonny's running wild. He wants
to go to mattresses already.

466
00:53:37,760 --> 00:53:42,993
We have to find a spot on the
West Side. Try 309 West 43rd Street.

467
00:53:43,200 --> 00:53:46,556
- Know a good spot on the West Side?
- I'll think about it.

468
00:53:46,760 --> 00:53:50,196
Think while you're driving.
I want to hit New York this month.

469
00:53:50,400 --> 00:53:52,231
Watch the kids.

470
00:54:02,360 --> 00:54:07,878
Paulie, go down 39th Street, pick up
18 mattresses and bring me the bill.

471
00:54:08,080 --> 00:54:09,433
Yeah, all right.

472
00:54:09,640 --> 00:54:13,872
Make sure they're clean, because
the guys will be there a long time.

473
00:54:14,080 --> 00:54:18,039
- They're clean and exterminated.
- That's a bad word to use.

474
00:54:18,240 --> 00:54:21,949
Exterminate! Watch out,
so we don't exterminate you!

475
00:54:28,440 --> 00:54:30,954
Pull over. I've got to take a leak.

476
00:55:11,040 --> 00:55:14,157
Leave the gun. Take the <i>cannoli.</i>
