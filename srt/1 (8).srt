1
00:00:47,747 --> 00:00:49,305
I believe in America.

2
00:00:50,617 --> 00:00:52,608
America has made my fortune...

3
00:00:53,720 --> 00:00:56,143
and I raised my daughter
in the American fashion.

4
00:00:57,891 --> 00:01:00,655
I give her freedom,
but I taught her...

5
00:01:00,760 --> 00:01:02,751
never to dishonor her family.

6
00:01:04,130 --> 00:01:07,361
She found a boyfriend.
Not an Italian.

7
00:01:07,467 --> 00:01:09,697
She went to the movies with him.

8
00:01:09,803 --> 00:01:12,897
She stayed out late.
I didn't protest.

9
00:01:14,674 --> 00:01:17,507
Two months ago,
he took her for a drive...

10
00:01:17,610 --> 00:01:19,100
with another boyfriend.

11
00:01:20,447 --> 00:01:23,075
They made her drink whiskey...

12
00:01:23,183 --> 00:01:26,380
and then they tried
to take advantage of her.

13
00:01:27,620 --> 00:01:29,679
She resisted.

14
00:01:29,789 --> 00:01:31,518
She kept her honor.

15
00:01:33,026 --> 00:01:36,052
So they beat her
like an animal.

16
00:01:37,997 --> 00:01:41,694
When I went to the hospital,
her nose was broken...

17
00:01:43,002 --> 00:01:45,027
her jaw was shattered...

18
00:01:45,138 --> 00:01:47,265
held together by wire.

19
00:01:49,676 --> 00:01:52,236
She couldn't even weep
because of the pain.

20
00:01:55,081 --> 00:01:58,573
But I wept.
Why did I weep?

21
00:02:01,254 --> 00:02:03,245
She was the light of my life.

22
00:02:05,625 --> 00:02:07,024
Beautiful girl.

23
00:02:11,097 --> 00:02:13,156
Now she will never
be beautiful again.

24
00:02:20,740 --> 00:02:21,968
Sorry.

25
00:02:31,384 --> 00:02:33,750
I went to the police
like a good American.

26
00:02:34,954 --> 00:02:36,979
These two boys
were brought to trial.

27
00:02:38,758 --> 00:02:41,522
A judge sentence them
to three years in prison...

28
00:02:41,628 --> 00:02:43,516
and suspend their sentence.

29
00:02:44,931 --> 00:02:47,422
Suspended sentence.

30
00:02:47,500 --> 00:02:49,923
They went free that very day.

31
00:02:52,172 --> 00:02:54,367
I stood in the courtroom
like a fool.

32
00:02:55,542 --> 00:02:58,807
And those two bastard,
they smiled at me.

33
00:03:00,380 --> 00:03:03,804
Then I said to my wife,
" For justice...

34
00:03:03,917 --> 00:03:05,873
we must go to Don Corleone. "

35
00:03:11,324 --> 00:03:14,623
Why did you go to the police?
Why didn't you come to me first?

36
00:03:15,795 --> 00:03:17,524
What do you want of me?

37
00:03:17,630 --> 00:03:20,724
Tell me anything,
but do what I beg you to do.

38
00:03:21,935 --> 00:03:23,334
What is that?

39
00:03:48,328 --> 00:03:49,522
That I cannot do.

40
00:03:51,331 --> 00:03:53,356
I'll give you anything you ask.

41
00:03:56,236 --> 00:03:59,000
We've known each other many years,
but this is the first time...

42
00:03:59,105 --> 00:04:02,438
you ever came to me
for counsel or for help.

43
00:04:02,542 --> 00:04:05,466
I can't remember the last time
that you invited me...

44
00:04:05,578 --> 00:04:07,534
to your house
for a cup of coffee...

45
00:04:09,148 --> 00:04:12,811
even though my wife
is godmother to your only child.

46
00:04:12,919 --> 00:04:15,080
But let's be frank.

47
00:04:15,188 --> 00:04:17,076
You never wanted my friendship...

48
00:04:18,191 --> 00:04:21,820
and you were afraid
to be in my debt.

49
00:04:21,928 --> 00:04:23,953
I didn't want
to get into trouble.

50
00:04:25,531 --> 00:04:26,828
I understand.

51
00:04:28,434 --> 00:04:30,459
You found paradise in America.

52
00:04:33,740 --> 00:04:35,628
You had a good trade,
made a good living.

53
00:04:35,742 --> 00:04:38,438
Police protected you,
and there were courts of law.

54
00:04:38,544 --> 00:04:40,432
So you didn't need
a friend like me.

55
00:04:42,882 --> 00:04:46,443
But now you come to me
and you say...

56
00:04:46,552 --> 00:04:48,508
"Don Corleone, give me justice. "

57
00:04:50,790 --> 00:04:53,645
But you don't ask with respect.

58
00:04:53,760 --> 00:04:56,320
You don't offer friendship.

59
00:04:56,429 --> 00:04:58,385
You don't even think
to call me "Godfather. "

60
00:05:00,099 --> 00:05:01,760
Instead, you come
into my house...

61
00:05:01,868 --> 00:05:03,756
on the day my daughter
is to be married...

62
00:05:03,870 --> 00:05:06,361
and you ask me to do murder
for money.

63
00:05:07,206 --> 00:05:09,766
I ask you for justice.

64
00:05:09,876 --> 00:05:12,606
That is not justice.
Your daughter is still alive.

65
00:05:13,913 --> 00:05:17,269
They must suffer then
as she suffers.

66
00:05:19,352 --> 00:05:21,445
How much shall I pay you?

67
00:05:36,402 --> 00:05:37,630
Bonasera.

68
00:05:40,440 --> 00:05:43,796
What have I ever done to make you
treat me so disrespectfully?

69
00:05:45,611 --> 00:05:48,171
If you’d come to me
in friendship...

70
00:05:48,281 --> 00:05:50,169
then the scum
that ruined your daughter...

71
00:05:50,283 --> 00:05:52,239
would be suffering
this very day.

72
00:05:53,753 --> 00:05:54,913
And if, by chance...

73
00:05:55,021 --> 00:05:56,977
an honest man like yourself
should make enemies...

74
00:05:57,090 --> 00:05:59,046
then they would become
my enemies.

75
00:06:01,694 --> 00:06:03,958
And then they would fear you.

76
00:06:08,267 --> 00:06:09,222
Be my friend?

77
00:06:14,207 --> 00:06:15,162
Godfather.

78
00:06:20,279 --> 00:06:21,337
Good.

79
00:06:23,449 --> 00:06:25,713
Someday, and that day
may never come...

80
00:06:25,818 --> 00:06:28,048
I'll call upon you
to do a service for me.

81
00:06:30,123 --> 00:06:32,114
But until that day...

82
00:06:33,893 --> 00:06:36,885
accept this justice as a gift
on my daughter's wedding day.

83
00:06:38,364 --> 00:06:39,695
Grazie, Godfather.

84
00:06:47,907 --> 00:06:50,239
Give this to Clemenza.

85
00:06:52,912 --> 00:06:54,243
I want reliable people...

86
00:06:54,347 --> 00:06:56,440
people that aren't
going to be carried away.

87
00:06:56,549 --> 00:06:57,982
I mean, we're not murderers...

88
00:06:58,084 --> 00:07:00,644
in spite of what
this undertaker says.

89
00:07:25,978 --> 00:07:27,536
- Where's Michael?
- What? Don't worry.

90
00:07:27,647 --> 00:07:29,308
It's early. He'll be here.

91
00:07:29,415 --> 00:07:30,541
We're not taking it.

92
00:07:30,650 --> 00:07:32,538
We're not taking the picture
without Michael.

93
00:07:39,525 --> 00:07:41,481
- What's the matter, Sonny?
- It's Michael.

94
00:08:32,044 --> 00:08:33,272
Don Barzini.

95
00:08:50,263 --> 00:08:53,391
Hey, Paulie!
Let me have some wine.

96
00:08:53,499 --> 00:08:56,059
Paulie! More wine.

97
00:08:56,168 --> 00:08:57,328
Scusi, please.

98
00:08:57,436 --> 00:08:59,165
You look "terrif" on the floor.

99
00:08:59,272 --> 00:09:01,103
What are you,
a dance judge or something?

100
00:09:02,775 --> 00:09:04,970
Go take a walk around
the neighborhood. Do your job.

101
00:09:12,818 --> 00:09:14,706
Sandra, come on. Do me a favor.
Watch the kids.

102
00:09:14,820 --> 00:09:17,550
- Don't let 'em run wild.
- You watch yourself, all right?

103
00:09:39,946 --> 00:09:42,141
Twenty or thirty grand.

104
00:09:42,248 --> 00:09:43,977
In small bills, cash.

105
00:09:45,084 --> 00:09:47,040
In that little silk purse.

106
00:09:48,020 --> 00:09:49,908
If this was
somebody else's wedding.

107
00:09:51,190 --> 00:09:53,988
Hey, Paulie!
I got two gobbagool...

108
00:09:54,093 --> 00:09:55,856
gabagol and a prosciutto.

109
00:09:55,962 --> 00:09:57,486
Stupid jerk!

110
00:10:06,672 --> 00:10:08,105
Hey, what's the matter?

111
00:10:20,753 --> 00:10:22,311
Have to go back to work.

112
00:10:23,155 --> 00:10:24,383
It's part of the wedding.

113
00:10:24,490 --> 00:10:27,379
No Sicilian can refuse any request
on his daughter's wedding day.

114
00:10:33,432 --> 00:10:35,662
Don Corleone,
I am honored and grateful...

115
00:10:35,768 --> 00:10:37,724
that you have invited me
to your home-

116
00:10:42,942 --> 00:10:44,034
Get outta here.

117
00:10:44,143 --> 00:10:46,099
This is a private party.
Go on.

118
00:10:47,580 --> 00:10:49,707
What is it?
Hey, my sister's wedding.

119
00:10:57,156 --> 00:10:59,215
Goddamn FBI
don't respect nothin'.

120
00:11:02,328 --> 00:11:05,627
Hey, come here, come here.
Come here!

121
00:11:06,999 --> 00:11:08,296
There.

122
00:11:20,413 --> 00:11:22,404
But towards the end
he was paroled...

123
00:11:22,515 --> 00:11:25,143
to help with
the American war effort.

124
00:11:25,251 --> 00:11:27,412
For the last six months, he's been
working at my pastry shop.

125
00:11:28,354 --> 00:11:30,413
Nazorine, my friend,
what can I do for you?

126
00:11:30,523 --> 00:11:33,014
Now that the war is over...

127
00:11:33,092 --> 00:11:36,152
this boy, Enzo, they want
to repatriate him back to Italy.

128
00:11:37,263 --> 00:11:39,823
Godfather, I have a daughter.

129
00:11:39,932 --> 00:11:42,162
See, she and Enzo-

130
00:11:43,369 --> 00:11:45,325
You want Enzo to stay
in this country...

131
00:11:45,438 --> 00:11:47,133
and you want your daughter
to be married.

132
00:11:49,008 --> 00:11:50,407
You understand everything.

133
00:11:52,211 --> 00:11:54,167
Mr. Hagen. Thank you.

134
00:11:57,283 --> 00:11:59,171
And wait till you see
the beautiful wedding cake...

135
00:11:59,285 --> 00:12:00,616
I made for your daughter.

136
00:12:00,720 --> 00:12:03,280
Like this, with the bride
and the groom and-

137
00:12:09,562 --> 00:12:12,622
- Who should I give this job to?
- Not to our paisan.

138
00:12:14,333 --> 00:12:16,927
Give it to a Jew congressman
in another district.

139
00:12:18,070 --> 00:12:19,560
Who else is on the list?

140
00:12:26,712 --> 00:12:28,805
Hey, Michael.
How are you?

141
00:12:28,914 --> 00:12:29,869
Hello.

142
00:12:48,100 --> 00:12:50,830
He's not on the list,
but Luca Brasi wants to see you.

143
00:12:57,276 --> 00:12:59,506
Is this necessary?

144
00:12:59,612 --> 00:13:01,443
He didn't expect to be invited
to the wedding...

145
00:13:01,547 --> 00:13:03,503
so he wanted to thank you.

146
00:13:03,616 --> 00:13:04,514
All right.

147
00:13:05,317 --> 00:13:08,548
Don Corleone,
I am honored and grateful...

148
00:13:08,654 --> 00:13:11,145
that you have invited me
to your home...

149
00:13:11,257 --> 00:13:13,213
on the wedding day
of your daughter.

150
00:13:14,160 --> 00:13:16,651
And may their first child
be a masculine child.

151
00:13:16,762 --> 00:13:19,287
- Don-
- Michael?

152
00:13:19,398 --> 00:13:20,888
Don Corleone-

153
00:13:20,966 --> 00:13:23,264
That man over there
is talking to himself.

154
00:13:24,370 --> 00:13:26,258
See that scary guy over there?

155
00:13:27,406 --> 00:13:28,600
He's a very scary guy.

156
00:13:28,707 --> 00:13:30,334
Who is he?
What's his name?

157
00:13:31,043 --> 00:13:33,637
His name is Luca Brasi...

158
00:13:33,746 --> 00:13:35,441
and he helps my father out
sometimes.

159
00:13:36,849 --> 00:13:39,545
Wait a minute.
He's coming over here.

160
00:13:44,723 --> 00:13:46,520
You look terrific!

161
00:13:46,625 --> 00:13:48,718
My brother Tom Hagen.
This is Kay Adams.

162
00:13:48,828 --> 00:13:51,353
How do you do?
Nice to meet you.

163
00:13:51,463 --> 00:13:53,727
Your father's
been asking for you.

164
00:13:53,833 --> 00:13:55,460
- Very nice to meet you.
- Nice to meet you.

165
00:13:55,568 --> 00:13:56,796
I'll be there.

166
00:13:58,437 --> 00:14:01,133
If he's your brother,
why does he have a different name?

167
00:14:02,241 --> 00:14:04,129
When my brother Sonny
was a kid...

168
00:14:04,243 --> 00:14:06,541
he found Tom Hagen in the street,
and he had no home.

169
00:14:07,646 --> 00:14:09,602
So my father took him in...

170
00:14:10,716 --> 00:14:12,377
and he's been with us ever since.

171
00:14:13,919 --> 00:14:15,409
He's a good lawyer.

172
00:14:16,856 --> 00:14:19,120
Not a Sicilian, but...

173
00:14:19,225 --> 00:14:21,455
I think
he's gonna be consigliere.

174
00:14:21,560 --> 00:14:23,516
- What's that?
- That's...

175
00:14:24,630 --> 00:14:26,222
like a counselor, an advisor.

176
00:14:26,332 --> 00:14:28,288
Very important to the family.

177
00:14:29,401 --> 00:14:31,460
You like your lasagna?

178
00:14:35,875 --> 00:14:40,801
Don Corleone,
I am honored and grateful...

179
00:14:40,913 --> 00:14:44,144
that you have invited me
to your daughter's wedding...

180
00:14:49,755 --> 00:14:52,087
on the day
of your daughter's wedding.

181
00:14:53,192 --> 00:14:56,025
And I hope
that their first child...

182
00:14:56,128 --> 00:14:58,084
be a masculine child.

183
00:14:59,465 --> 00:15:04,493
I pledge my ever-ending loyalty.

184
00:15:06,372 --> 00:15:08,260
For your daughter's
bridal purse.

185
00:15:08,374 --> 00:15:11,366
Thank you, Luca,
my most valued friend.

186
00:15:11,477 --> 00:15:14,935
Don Corleone,
I'm gonna leave you now...

187
00:15:15,047 --> 00:15:17,003
because I know you are busy.

188
00:15:17,116 --> 00:15:18,447
Thank you.

189
00:17:23,342 --> 00:17:26,106
Senator Cauly apologized
for not coming personally...

190
00:17:26,211 --> 00:17:27,940
but said you'd understand.

191
00:17:29,048 --> 00:17:30,936
Also some of the judges.

192
00:17:32,051 --> 00:17:33,313
They've all sent gifts.

193
00:17:36,388 --> 00:17:37,650
What is that outside?

194
00:17:46,865 --> 00:17:49,527
Johnny!

195
00:17:52,471 --> 00:17:53,529
I love you.

196
00:18:01,046 --> 00:18:03,674
Hey, Johnny, look over here!

197
00:18:03,782 --> 00:18:06,512
He came all the way from California
to come to the wedding.

198
00:18:06,618 --> 00:18:08,609
- I told you he was going to come.
- It's been two years.

199
00:18:08,720 --> 00:18:11,109
- He's probably in trouble again.
- He's a good godson.

200
00:18:15,461 --> 00:18:16,689
Sing a song.

201
00:18:32,144 --> 00:18:34,999
Michael, you never told me
you knew Johnny Fontane.

202
00:18:35,114 --> 00:18:39,073
- Sure. You wanna meet him?
- Huh? Oh, well, sure.

203
00:18:39,184 --> 00:18:41,140
My father helped him
with his career.

204
00:18:41,253 --> 00:18:44,347
- For my Connie.
- He did? How?

205
00:18:44,456 --> 00:18:46,117
I have but one

206
00:18:46,225 --> 00:18:47,749
- Let's listen to the song.
- No.

207
00:18:47,860 --> 00:18:49,691
Heart

208
00:18:49,795 --> 00:18:53,492
This heart I bring you

209
00:18:55,100 --> 00:18:59,423
I have but one heart

210
00:18:59,538 --> 00:19:01,369
To share with you

211
00:19:04,510 --> 00:19:08,776
I have but one dream

212
00:19:08,881 --> 00:19:12,476
That I can cling to

213
00:19:13,952 --> 00:19:18,651
You are the one dream

214
00:19:18,757 --> 00:19:22,022
I'll pray comes true

215
00:19:22,961 --> 00:19:25,054
Please, Michael. T ell me.

216
00:19:25,164 --> 00:19:28,827
My darling, until I saw you

217
00:19:28,934 --> 00:19:30,822
When Johnny
was first starting out...

218
00:19:30,936 --> 00:19:33,791
he was signed to this
personal service contract...

219
00:19:33,906 --> 00:19:35,339
with a big bandleader.

220
00:19:36,842 --> 00:19:38,798
And as his career
got better and better...

221
00:19:38,911 --> 00:19:40,799
he wanted to get out of it.

222
00:19:42,114 --> 00:19:44,810
Now, Johnny is
my father's godson...

223
00:19:44,917 --> 00:19:47,147
and my father went
to see this bandleader...

224
00:19:48,353 --> 00:19:50,844
and he offered him
$10,000 to let Johnny go.

225
00:19:52,324 --> 00:19:54,280
But the bandleader said no.

226
00:19:55,227 --> 00:19:58,287
So the next day
my father went to see him...

227
00:19:58,397 --> 00:20:00,353
only this time
with Luca Brasi.

228
00:20:02,534 --> 00:20:05,628
And within an hour,
he signed a release...

229
00:20:07,773 --> 00:20:10,401
for a certified check of $1,000.

230
00:20:12,077 --> 00:20:13,169
How'd he do that?

231
00:20:13,278 --> 00:20:15,803
My father made him an offer
he couldn't refuse.

232
00:20:17,249 --> 00:20:18,409
What was that?

233
00:20:19,885 --> 00:20:22,581
Luca Brasi
held a gun to his head...

234
00:20:22,688 --> 00:20:24,849
and my father assured him
that either his brains...

235
00:20:24,957 --> 00:20:27,323
or his signature
would be on the contract.

236
00:20:33,031 --> 00:20:34,589
That's a true story.

237
00:20:45,911 --> 00:20:48,175
That's my family, Kay.
It's not me.

238
00:21:01,260 --> 00:21:02,488
Beautiful!

239
00:21:11,703 --> 00:21:13,967
My godson comes all the way
from California.

240
00:21:14,072 --> 00:21:15,960
Give him a glass of wine.

241
00:21:35,294 --> 00:21:37,319
I'll take care of it.

242
00:21:39,364 --> 00:21:42,253
I want you to find Santino.
Tell him to come to the office.

243
00:21:50,309 --> 00:21:52,265
How are you, Fredo?

244
00:21:53,445 --> 00:21:55,436
My brother Fredo.
This is Kay Adams.

245
00:21:57,049 --> 00:21:59,005
- Hi.
- How ya doin'?

246
00:22:01,320 --> 00:22:04,517
- This is my brother Mike.
- Are you having a good time?

247
00:22:04,623 --> 00:22:06,853
Yeah.
This is your friend, huh?

248
00:22:08,360 --> 00:22:12,524
I don't know what to do.
My voice is weak.

249
00:22:12,631 --> 00:22:13,723
It's weak.

250
00:22:14,966 --> 00:22:17,594
Anyway, if I had this part
in the picture...

251
00:22:17,703 --> 00:22:20,331
it puts me right back
up on top again.

252
00:22:21,440 --> 00:22:22,668
But this...

253
00:22:24,109 --> 00:22:26,100
this man out there,
he won't give it to me.

254
00:22:26,211 --> 00:22:28,167
- The head of the studio.
- What's his name?

255
00:22:28,280 --> 00:22:30,874
Woltz.
He won't give it to me...

256
00:22:30,982 --> 00:22:34,543
and he says
there's no chance, no chance.

257
00:22:38,557 --> 00:22:39,717
Sonny?

258
00:22:49,301 --> 00:22:51,929
Sonny, you in there?

259
00:22:53,071 --> 00:22:55,460
- What?
- The old man wants to see you.

260
00:22:56,942 --> 00:22:58,830
Yeah, one minute.

261
00:23:13,458 --> 00:23:16,484
A month ago, he bought
the movie rights to this book.

262
00:23:16,595 --> 00:23:18,324
A best-seller.

263
00:23:18,430 --> 00:23:20,625
And the main character
is a guy just like me.

264
00:23:20,732 --> 00:23:23,223
Why, I wouldn't even
have to act.

265
00:23:23,335 --> 00:23:24,632
Just be myself.

266
00:23:24,736 --> 00:23:28,593
Oh, Godfather,
I don't know what to do.

267
00:23:29,975 --> 00:23:32,933
You can act like a man!
What's the matter with you?

268
00:23:34,279 --> 00:23:35,678
Is this how you turned out?

269
00:23:35,781 --> 00:23:38,409
A Hollywood finocchio
that cries like a woman?

270
00:23:40,085 --> 00:23:42,315
"What can I do?"

271
00:23:42,421 --> 00:23:43,911
What is that nonsense?

272
00:23:43,989 --> 00:23:45,854
Ridiculous!

273
00:23:50,462 --> 00:23:53,761
- You spend time with your family?
- Sure I do.

274
00:23:53,865 --> 00:23:55,355
Good.

275
00:23:55,434 --> 00:23:57,425
Because the man who doesn't
spend time with his family...

276
00:23:57,536 --> 00:23:59,766
can never be a real man.

277
00:23:59,871 --> 00:24:01,031
Come here.

278
00:24:05,844 --> 00:24:08,335
You look terrible.
I want you to eat.

279
00:24:09,448 --> 00:24:11,473
I want you to rest well,
and a month from now...

280
00:24:11,583 --> 00:24:14,711
this Hollywood big shot's
gonna give you what you want.

281
00:24:14,820 --> 00:24:16,981
Too late.
They start shooting in a week.

282
00:24:18,089 --> 00:24:20,353
I'm gonna make him an offer
he can't refuse.

283
00:24:24,029 --> 00:24:25,985
Now just go outside,
enjoy yourself...

284
00:24:26,097 --> 00:24:28,691
and forget about
all this nonsense.

285
00:24:30,202 --> 00:24:32,796
Listen. I want you
to leave it all to me.

286
00:24:33,738 --> 00:24:34,693
All right.

287
00:24:59,464 --> 00:25:02,228
What time does my daughter
leave with the bridegroom?

288
00:25:02,334 --> 00:25:04,723
In a few minutes,
right after they cut the cake.

289
00:25:04,836 --> 00:25:08,033
Now, your new son-in-law,
we give him something important.

290
00:25:08,139 --> 00:25:10,403
Never.
Give him a living...

291
00:25:10,509 --> 00:25:13,535
but never discuss
the family business with him.

292
00:25:13,645 --> 00:25:14,942
What else?

293
00:25:15,046 --> 00:25:16,536
Virgil Sollozzo called.

294
00:25:16,648 --> 00:25:18,946
We have to give him a day
sometime next week.

295
00:25:19,050 --> 00:25:21,041
We'll discuss him when you
come back from California.

296
00:25:22,387 --> 00:25:23,820
When am I going to California?

297
00:25:23,922 --> 00:25:25,913
I want you to go tonight.

298
00:25:26,024 --> 00:25:28,822
I want you to talk
to this movie big shot...

299
00:25:28,927 --> 00:25:30,883
and settle this business
for Johnny.

300
00:25:32,464 --> 00:25:35,353
If there's nothing else, I'd like
to go to my daughter's wedding.

301
00:25:38,737 --> 00:25:40,796
Carlo, we're gonna take
the picture.

302
00:25:42,874 --> 00:25:43,932
Wait a minute.

303
00:25:44,709 --> 00:25:46,597
No, Michael, not me.

304
00:25:50,115 --> 00:25:51,343
Just a little closer.

305
00:25:51,449 --> 00:25:53,440
Okay, that's it.
Just like that now. Hold it.

306
00:27:38,790 --> 00:27:40,348
Isn't that nice?

307
00:27:46,264 --> 00:27:47,891
All right, start talking.

308
00:27:47,999 --> 00:27:50,194
I was sent by a friend
of Johnny Fontane.

309
00:27:51,302 --> 00:27:53,964
This friend is my client and would
give his undying friendship...

310
00:27:54,072 --> 00:27:57,803
to Mr. Woltz if Mr. Woltz
would grant us a small favor.

311
00:27:57,909 --> 00:27:59,308
Woltz is listening.

312
00:28:00,412 --> 00:28:03,506
Give Johnny the part in that new
war film you're starting next week.

313
00:28:10,188 --> 00:28:13,180
And what favor
would your friend...

314
00:28:13,291 --> 00:28:15,088
grant Mr. Woltz?

315
00:28:15,193 --> 00:28:16,990
You're gonna have
some union problems.

316
00:28:17,095 --> 00:28:18,824
My client
could make them disappear.

317
00:28:18,930 --> 00:28:20,955
Also, one of your top stars
has just moved...

318
00:28:21,066 --> 00:28:22,954
from marijuana to heroin.

319
00:28:23,068 --> 00:28:24,956
- Are you trying to muscle me?
- Absolutely not.

320
00:28:25,070 --> 00:28:27,368
Listen to me,
you smooth-talking son of a bitch!

321
00:28:27,472 --> 00:28:30,134
Let me lay it on the line for you
and your boss, whoever he is!

322
00:28:30,241 --> 00:28:31,765
Johnny Fontane
will never get that movie.

323
00:28:31,876 --> 00:28:34,265
I don't care
how many dago, guinea, wop...

324
00:28:34,379 --> 00:28:36,643
greaseball goombahs
come outta the woodwork.

325
00:28:36,748 --> 00:28:37,908
I'm German-Irish.

326
00:28:38,016 --> 00:28:40,610
Well, let me tell you something,
my kraut mick friend.

327
00:28:40,719 --> 00:28:43,608
I'll make so much trouble for you,
you won't know what hit you.

328
00:28:43,722 --> 00:28:45,610
I'm a lawyer.
I have not threatened-

329
00:28:45,724 --> 00:28:48,613
I know almost every big lawyer
in New York. Who are you?

330
00:28:48,727 --> 00:28:51,958
I have a special practice.
I handle one client.

331
00:28:52,063 --> 00:28:53,951
Now, you have my number.
I'll wait for your call.

332
00:28:55,967 --> 00:28:58,356
By the way, I admire
your pictures very much.

333
00:29:03,408 --> 00:29:04,807
Check him out.

334
00:29:27,732 --> 00:29:30,223
- This is really beautiful.
- Look at this.

335
00:29:30,335 --> 00:29:32,428
Used to decorate
the palace of a king.

336
00:29:32,537 --> 00:29:34,732
Oh, yeah. Very nice.

337
00:29:34,839 --> 00:29:37,467
Why didn't you say
you worked for Corleone, Tom?

338
00:29:37,575 --> 00:29:39,736
I thought you were just
some cheap, two-bit hustler...

339
00:29:39,844 --> 00:29:41,800
Johnny was running in,
trying to bluff me.

340
00:29:41,913 --> 00:29:44,302
I don't like to use his name
unless it's really necessary.

341
00:29:44,415 --> 00:29:45,905
- How's your drink, Tom?
- Fine.

342
00:29:46,017 --> 00:29:48,747
Come with me. I want to show you
something really beautiful.

343
00:29:48,853 --> 00:29:50,809
You do appreciate beauty,
don't you, Tom?

344
00:29:54,392 --> 00:29:57,418
There you are.
$600,000 on four hooves.

345
00:29:57,529 --> 00:29:58,757
I'll bet Russian czars...

346
00:29:58,863 --> 00:30:01,093
never paid that kind of dough
for a single horse.

347
00:30:01,199 --> 00:30:02,427
Khartoum.

348
00:30:06,571 --> 00:30:10,530
I'm not gonna race him, though.
I'm gonna put him out to stud.

349
00:30:10,642 --> 00:30:12,132
Beautiful.

350
00:30:12,210 --> 00:30:13,768
- Thanks, Tony.
- You're welcome.

351
00:30:13,878 --> 00:30:15,834
- Come on.
- Let's get something to eat.

352
00:30:17,849 --> 00:30:20,215
Mr. Corleone
is Johnny's godfather.

353
00:30:21,319 --> 00:30:23,583
To the Italian people,
that's a very religious...

354
00:30:23,688 --> 00:30:25,576
sacred, close relationship.

355
00:30:25,690 --> 00:30:26,714
I respect that.

356
00:30:26,825 --> 00:30:29,316
Just tell him he should ask me
anything else.

357
00:30:29,427 --> 00:30:31,190
This is one favor
I can't give him.

358
00:30:32,230 --> 00:30:34,721
He never asks a second favor
when he's been refused the first.

359
00:30:34,799 --> 00:30:37,791
- Understood?
- You don't understand.

360
00:30:37,902 --> 00:30:40,291
Johnny Fontane
never gets that movie.

361
00:30:41,840 --> 00:30:45,503
That part is perfect for him.
It'll make him a big star.

362
00:30:45,610 --> 00:30:47,498
I'm gonna run him
out of the business.

363
00:30:47,612 --> 00:30:49,170
Let me tell you why.

364
00:30:51,816 --> 00:30:54,478
Johnny Fontane ruined
one of Woltz International's...

365
00:30:54,586 --> 00:30:56,474
most valuable proteges.

366
00:30:56,588 --> 00:30:58,818
For five years,
we had her under training.

367
00:30:58,923 --> 00:31:01,983
Singing lessons,
acting lessons, dancing lessons.

368
00:31:02,093 --> 00:31:04,391
I spent hundreds of thousands
of dollars on her.

369
00:31:04,495 --> 00:31:06,690
I was gonna make her
a big star.

370
00:31:06,798 --> 00:31:09,528
And let me be
even more frank.

371
00:31:09,634 --> 00:31:11,932
Just to show you that I'm not
a hard-hearted man...

372
00:31:12,036 --> 00:31:14,561
that it's not all
dollars and cents.

373
00:31:14,672 --> 00:31:18,301
She was beautiful.
She was young, she was innocent!

374
00:31:18,409 --> 00:31:20,604
She was the greatest piece of ass
I've ever had...

375
00:31:20,712 --> 00:31:22,976
and I've had 'em
all over the world!

376
00:31:23,915 --> 00:31:25,974
And then Johnny Fontane
comes along...

377
00:31:26,084 --> 00:31:28,973
with his olive oil voice
and guinea charm.

378
00:31:30,288 --> 00:31:31,653
And she runs off.

379
00:31:33,157 --> 00:31:36,149
She threw it all away
just to make me look ridiculous...

380
00:31:37,362 --> 00:31:39,694
and a man in my position
can't afford...

381
00:31:39,797 --> 00:31:42,561
to be made
to look ridiculous!

382
00:31:42,667 --> 00:31:44,965
Now you get the hell outta here!

383
00:31:45,069 --> 00:31:47,094
And if that goombah
tries any rough stuff...

384
00:31:47,205 --> 00:31:49,332
you tell him
I ain't no bandleader.

385
00:31:50,975 --> 00:31:53,603
Yeah. I heard that story.

386
00:31:54,712 --> 00:31:56,942
Thank you for the dinner
and a very pleasant evening.

387
00:31:58,650 --> 00:32:01,244
If your car could take me
to the airport...

388
00:32:01,352 --> 00:32:05,140
Mr. Corleone is a man who insists
on hearing bad news immediately.

389
00:33:58,102 --> 00:34:01,799
- You're not too tired, Tom?
- No, I slept on the plane.

390
00:34:01,906 --> 00:34:03,794
I have the Sollozzo notes here.

391
00:34:05,043 --> 00:34:06,305
Now...

392
00:34:08,346 --> 00:34:10,507
Sollozzo is known as
"The Turk. "

393
00:34:11,816 --> 00:34:13,772
He's supposed to be
very good with a knife...

394
00:34:13,885 --> 00:34:15,580
but only
in matters of business...

395
00:34:15,686 --> 00:34:17,642
with some sort
of reasonable complaint.

396
00:34:18,956 --> 00:34:21,516
His business is narcotics.

397
00:34:21,626 --> 00:34:24,959
He has fields in Turkey
where they grow the poppy...

398
00:34:25,063 --> 00:34:27,952
and in Sicily he has the plants
to process them into heroin.

399
00:34:29,233 --> 00:34:32,623
Now, he needs cash and he needs
protection from the police...

400
00:34:32,737 --> 00:34:34,728
for which he gives
a piece of the action.

401
00:34:34,839 --> 00:34:36,727
I couldn't find out how much.

402
00:34:36,841 --> 00:34:39,639
The Tattaglia family
is behind him here in New York.

403
00:34:39,744 --> 00:34:41,803
Now, they have to be
in it for something.

404
00:34:41,913 --> 00:34:42,937
Santino Corleone.

405
00:34:43,047 --> 00:34:44,810
What about his prison record?

406
00:34:44,916 --> 00:34:46,872
Two terms,
one in Italy, one here.

407
00:34:47,985 --> 00:34:50,374
He's known as
a top narcotics man.

408
00:34:50,488 --> 00:34:52,718
Santino, what do you think?

409
00:34:54,092 --> 00:34:55,980
There's a lot of money
in that white powder.

410
00:34:57,929 --> 00:34:59,123
Tom?

411
00:34:59,230 --> 00:35:01,721
I say, yes, there's more
money potential in narcotics...

412
00:35:01,799 --> 00:35:03,687
than anything else
we're looking at.

413
00:35:03,801 --> 00:35:06,133
If we don't get into it,
somebody else will.

414
00:35:06,237 --> 00:35:08,262
Maybe one of the five families,
maybe all of them.

415
00:35:08,372 --> 00:35:09,464
With the money they earn...

416
00:35:09,574 --> 00:35:12,907
they can buy more police
and political power.

417
00:35:13,010 --> 00:35:15,103
Then they come after us.

418
00:35:15,213 --> 00:35:17,977
Now we have the unions,
we have the gambling...

419
00:35:18,082 --> 00:35:20,277
and they're the best things
to have, but narcotics...

420
00:35:20,384 --> 00:35:21,783
is a thing of the future.

421
00:35:21,886 --> 00:35:23,615
If we don't get
a piece of that action...

422
00:35:23,721 --> 00:35:25,120
we risk everything we have.

423
00:35:25,223 --> 00:35:27,111
Not now, but ten years from now.

424
00:35:31,262 --> 00:35:34,356
So? What's your answer
gonna be, Pop?

425
00:35:43,107 --> 00:35:45,234
I need a man
who has powerful friends.

426
00:35:46,511 --> 00:35:49,207
I need a million dollars in cash.

427
00:35:49,313 --> 00:35:51,304
I need, Don Corleone,
those politicians...

428
00:35:51,415 --> 00:35:55,078
that you carry in your pocket
like so many nickels and dimes.

429
00:35:56,654 --> 00:35:58,679
What is the interest
for my family?

430
00:35:58,789 --> 00:36:00,620
Thirty percent.

431
00:36:00,725 --> 00:36:03,523
In the first year, your end
should be 3, 4 million dollars.

432
00:36:04,829 --> 00:36:06,717
And then it would go up.

433
00:36:07,932 --> 00:36:10,298
And what is the interest
for the Tattaglia family?

434
00:36:13,437 --> 00:36:15,064
My compliments.

435
00:36:18,743 --> 00:36:21,371
I'll take care of the Tattaglias
outta my share.

436
00:36:22,380 --> 00:36:25,076
So, I receive 30%
for finance...

437
00:36:26,617 --> 00:36:28,573
political influence
and legal protection.

438
00:36:28,686 --> 00:36:30,984
- That's what you're telling me.
- That's right.

439
00:36:33,090 --> 00:36:36,981
Why do you come to me?
Why do I deserve this generosity?

440
00:36:37,094 --> 00:36:40,018
If you consider
a million dollars in cash...

441
00:36:40,131 --> 00:36:41,496
just "finance"-

442
00:36:55,179 --> 00:36:58,103
I said that I would see you
because...

443
00:36:58,216 --> 00:37:00,309
I heard that you were
a serious man...

444
00:37:00,418 --> 00:37:02,374
to be treated with respect.

445
00:37:07,558 --> 00:37:10,755
But I must say no to you.

446
00:37:11,929 --> 00:37:14,295
And I'll give you my reason.

447
00:37:14,398 --> 00:37:17,196
It's true, I have
a lot of friends in politics.

448
00:37:18,869 --> 00:37:20,757
But they wouldn't be friendly
very long...

449
00:37:20,871 --> 00:37:23,135
if they knew my business was drugs
instead of gambling...

450
00:37:23,241 --> 00:37:26,438
which they regard
as a harmless vice.

451
00:37:26,544 --> 00:37:29,172
- But drugs is a dirty business.
- No, Don Corleone-

452
00:37:29,280 --> 00:37:31,168
It doesn't make
any difference to me...

453
00:37:31,282 --> 00:37:34,046
what a man does for a living,
you understand...

454
00:37:34,151 --> 00:37:36,107
but your business is...

455
00:37:37,722 --> 00:37:39,349
a little dangerous.

456
00:37:39,457 --> 00:37:41,846
If you’re worried about security
for your million...

457
00:37:41,959 --> 00:37:43,551
the Tattaglias will guarantee it.

458
00:37:43,661 --> 00:37:46,391
You're tellin' me the Tattaglias
guarantee our investment-

459
00:37:46,497 --> 00:37:47,828
Wait a minute.

460
00:37:54,939 --> 00:37:56,964
I have a sentimental weakness
for my children...

461
00:37:57,074 --> 00:37:59,304
and I spoil them,
as you can see.

462
00:37:59,410 --> 00:38:01,002
They talk when they should listen.

463
00:38:01,112 --> 00:38:03,137
But anyway...

464
00:38:03,247 --> 00:38:05,738
Signor Sollozzo,
my "no" is final...

465
00:38:05,816 --> 00:38:08,614
and I wish to congratulate you
on your new business.

466
00:38:08,719 --> 00:38:11,984
I know you'll do very well,
and good luck to you...

467
00:38:12,089 --> 00:38:15,047
especially since your interests
don't conflict with mine.

468
00:38:16,494 --> 00:38:17,654
Thank you.

469
00:38:39,450 --> 00:38:40,678
Come here.

470
00:38:43,721 --> 00:38:45,450
What's the matter with you?

471
00:38:45,556 --> 00:38:47,251
I think your brain
is going soft...

472
00:38:47,358 --> 00:38:50,213
from all that comedy you're
playing with that young girl.

473
00:38:50,328 --> 00:38:53,718
Never tell anybody outside the
family what you're thinking again.

474
00:38:55,900 --> 00:38:56,958
Go on.

475
00:39:01,138 --> 00:39:03,868
Tom, what-
What is this nonsense?

476
00:39:03,974 --> 00:39:06,465
It's from Johnny.
He's starring in that new film.

477
00:39:09,146 --> 00:39:10,909
Well, take it away.

478
00:39:11,015 --> 00:39:12,414
Take it over there.

479
00:39:13,784 --> 00:39:15,274
And...

480
00:39:16,253 --> 00:39:18,141
tell Luca Brasi to come in.

481
00:39:24,595 --> 00:39:27,758
I'm a little worried
about this Sollozzo fellow.

482
00:39:27,865 --> 00:39:30,720
I want you to find out what
he's got under his fingernails.

483
00:39:32,069 --> 00:39:34,025
Go to the Tattaglias...

484
00:39:34,138 --> 00:39:36,368
and make them think...

485
00:39:36,474 --> 00:39:40,171
that you're not too happy
with our family...

486
00:39:41,278 --> 00:39:43,234
and find out what you can.

487
00:40:00,598 --> 00:40:04,557
And I got something
for your mother and for Sonny...

488
00:40:04,668 --> 00:40:06,624
and a tie for Freddy...

489
00:40:06,737 --> 00:40:09,433
and Tom Hagen
got the Reynolds pen.

490
00:40:09,540 --> 00:40:11,531
- What do you want for Christmas?
- Me?

491
00:40:11,642 --> 00:40:12,973
Oh, just you.

492
00:40:46,477 --> 00:40:48,365
Tell Paulie to get the car.
We're going.

493
00:40:48,479 --> 00:40:49,810
Okay, Pa.

494
00:40:49,914 --> 00:40:52,803
I'll have to get it myself.
Paulie called in sick this morning.

495
00:40:55,820 --> 00:40:58,311
Paulie's a good kid.
I don't mind gettin' the car.

496
00:41:47,371 --> 00:41:50,829
Luca, I am Bruno Tattaglia.

497
00:41:50,941 --> 00:41:52,306
I know.

498
00:41:52,409 --> 00:41:54,570
Scotch? Prewar.

499
00:42:01,385 --> 00:42:02,545
You know who I am?
