1
00:00:13,280 --> 00:00:16,238
Hey, Mike! Hey, Mikey!

2
00:00:17,760 --> 00:00:19,637
- Yeah.
- Phone call!

3
00:00:25,640 --> 00:00:27,995
- Who is it?
- Some girl.

4
00:00:32,040 --> 00:00:34,235
- Hello. Kay?
- <i>How's your father?</i>

5
00:00:34,440 --> 00:00:36,112
He's going to make it.

6
00:00:36,760 --> 00:00:38,716
<i>I love you.</i>

7
00:00:39,360 --> 00:00:41,316
<i>I love you!</i>

8
00:00:42,160 --> 00:00:44,549
- <i>Michael?</i>
- Yeah, I know.

9
00:00:44,760 --> 00:00:47,433
- <i>Tell me you love me.</i>
- I can't talk.

10
00:00:47,640 --> 00:00:49,790
<i>Can't you say it?</i>

11
00:00:50,560 --> 00:00:52,312
I'll see you tonight.

12
00:00:53,120 --> 00:00:56,078
Why don't you tell that nice girl
you love her?

13
00:00:56,280 --> 00:01:01,673
I love you with all my heart. If I don't
see you again soon, I'm going to die!

14
00:01:01,880 --> 00:01:06,396
Come and learn something. You might
have to cook for <i>2</i>0 guys some day.

15
00:01:06,600 --> 00:01:10,070
You start with a little oil,
then fry some garlic.

16
00:01:10,280 --> 00:01:15,354
Throw in some tomatoes, tomato paste,
fry it and make sure it doesn't stick.

17
00:01:15,560 --> 00:01:20,475
You get it to a boil, you shove in
all your sausage and meatballs.

18
00:01:21,320 --> 00:01:23,834
Add a little bit of wine.

19
00:01:26,400 --> 00:01:30,712
And a little bit of sugar. That's my trick.

20
00:01:30,920 --> 00:01:34,993
Cut the crap. I have more important
things for you. How's Paulie?

21
00:01:35,200 --> 00:01:38,112
You won't see him anymore.

22
00:01:38,320 --> 00:01:40,959
- Where are you going?
- To the city.

23
00:01:41,160 --> 00:01:44,391
- Send bodyguards with him.
- I'm going to the hospital...

24
00:01:44,600 --> 00:01:47,637
He'll be all right. Sollozzo knows
he's a civilian.

25
00:01:47,840 --> 00:01:50,434
- Be careful.
- Yes, sir.

26
00:01:52,680 --> 00:01:54,796
Send somebody with him anyway.

27
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:25,037
- I have to go.
- Can I go with you?

28
00:02:26,360 --> 00:02:30,638
No, Kay. There will be detectives there,
people from the press.

29
00:02:30,840 --> 00:02:33,195
I'll wait in the cab.

30
00:02:35,120 --> 00:02:38,078
I don't want you to get involved.

31
00:02:40,280 --> 00:02:43,431
When will I see you again?

32
00:02:48,480 --> 00:02:52,598
Go back to New Hampshire, and I'll
call you at your parents' house.

33
00:02:54,080 --> 00:02:58,949
- When will I see you again, Michael?
- I don't know.

34
00:05:05,240 --> 00:05:09,119
What are you doing here?
You're not supposed to be here.

35
00:05:09,320 --> 00:05:12,278
I'm Michael Corleone. This is my father.

36
00:05:12,480 --> 00:05:15,153
What happened to the guards?

37
00:05:15,360 --> 00:05:20,309
Your father had too many visitors.
They interfered with hospital service.

38
00:05:20,520 --> 00:05:23,956
The police made them leave
about ten minutes ago.

39
00:05:27,680 --> 00:05:31,673
Get me Long Beach 456<i>2</i>0, please.

40
00:05:34,040 --> 00:05:36,998
Nurse. Wait a minute. Stay here.

41
00:05:40,160 --> 00:05:44,756
Sonny, I'm at the hospital.
I got here late, there's nobody here.

42
00:05:44,960 --> 00:05:48,794
No Tessio's men, no detectives,
nobody. Papa's all alone.

43
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:51,639
- <i>Don't panic.</i>
- I won't panic.

44
00:05:52,840 --> 00:05:55,832
I'm sorry, but you will have to leave.

45
00:05:58,280 --> 00:06:03,752
We're going to move him to another
room. Can you disconnect the tubes?

46
00:06:03,960 --> 00:06:07,316
- That's out of the question!
- Do you know my father?

47
00:06:07,520 --> 00:06:11,479
Men are coming here to kill him.
Do you understand?

48
00:06:11,680 --> 00:06:13,716
Help me, please.

49
00:07:27,280 --> 00:07:31,114
- Who are you?
- I am Enzo, the baker.

50
00:07:31,920 --> 00:07:33,956
- Remember me?
- Enzo.

51
00:07:34,160 --> 00:07:36,913
You'd better go,
there's going to be trouble.

52
00:07:37,120 --> 00:07:41,716
If there is trouble, I'll stay here to
help you. For your father.

53
00:07:42,760 --> 00:07:47,356
Listen. Wait for me outside,
in front of the hospital, all right?

54
00:07:47,560 --> 00:07:49,596
I'll be out in a minute.

55
00:08:02,880 --> 00:08:07,078
Just lie here, Pop.
I'll take care of you now.

56
00:08:08,160 --> 00:08:10,310
I'm with you now.

57
00:08:11,640 --> 00:08:13,278
I'm with you.

58
00:08:47,160 --> 00:08:49,390
Get rid of these. Come here.

59
00:08:50,160 --> 00:08:55,109
Put your hand in your pocket, like you
have a gun. You'll be all right.

60
00:09:43,640 --> 00:09:45,756
You did good.

61
00:10:31,760 --> 00:10:34,957
I thought all you Guinea hoods
were locked up!

62
00:10:35,160 --> 00:10:39,199
- Why isn't anyone guarding my father?
- You little punk!

63
00:10:39,400 --> 00:10:43,279
Don't you tell me my business!
I pulled them off.

64
00:10:43,480 --> 00:10:49,191
- Stay away from this hospital!
- Not until my father's room is guarded.

65
00:10:49,800 --> 00:10:52,758
- Phil, take him in!
- The kid's clean, Captain.

66
00:10:52,960 --> 00:10:57,397
- He's a war hero. He's never been...
- I said take him in!

67
00:10:58,480 --> 00:11:04,510
- What's The Turk paying you?
- Take a hold of him. Stand him up.

68
00:11:04,720 --> 00:11:06,597
Stand him up straight.

69
00:11:27,800 --> 00:11:32,555
I'm the Corleone's attorney. These men
are hired to protect Vito Corleone.

70
00:11:32,760 --> 00:11:35,035
They're licensed to carry firearms.

71
00:11:35,240 --> 00:11:40,075
If you interfere, you'll have to appear
before the judge and show cause.

72
00:11:40,280 --> 00:11:42,350
Let him go.

73
00:12:13,160 --> 00:12:16,755
- What's with all the new faces?
- We'll need them now.

74
00:12:16,960 --> 00:12:19,520
After the hospital thing, Sonny got mad.

75
00:12:19,720 --> 00:12:22,632
We hit Bruno Tattaglia this morning.

76
00:12:23,720 --> 00:12:25,836
Jesus Christ.

77
00:12:32,120 --> 00:12:35,078
Looks like a fortress around here.

78
00:12:36,720 --> 00:12:41,635
<i>Tommasuccio!</i> Hey... 100 buttonmen
on the street 24 hours a day.

79
00:12:41,840 --> 00:12:45,674
That Turk shows one hair on his ass,
he's dead.

80
00:12:47,360 --> 00:12:49,396
Mike, let me look at you.

81
00:12:53,120 --> 00:12:56,157
You're beautiful, beautiful.
You're gorgeous.

82
00:12:56,360 --> 00:13:01,559
The Turk wants to talk! Imagine
the nerve of the son-of-a-bitch.

83
00:13:01,760 --> 00:13:04,479
- He wants a meeting today.
- What did he say?

84
00:13:04,680 --> 00:13:08,832
What did he say... He wants us to send
Michael to hear the proposition.

85
00:13:09,040 --> 00:13:12,032
He promises that the deal
is too good to refuse.

86
00:13:12,320 --> 00:13:15,392
- And Bruno Tattaglia?
- That's part of the deal.

87
00:13:15,600 --> 00:13:19,718
- He cancels out what they did to Father.
- We should listen to them.

88
00:13:19,920 --> 00:13:22,878
No more! Not this time, <i>Consigliere.</i>

89
00:13:23,080 --> 00:13:26,152
No more meetings, discussions,
or Sollozzo tricks.

90
00:13:26,360 --> 00:13:29,318
I want Sollozzo, or we go to war...

91
00:13:29,520 --> 00:13:32,080
- The other families...
- They hand me Sollozzo!

92
00:13:32,280 --> 00:13:34,840
This is business, not personal!

93
00:13:35,040 --> 00:13:39,511
- They shot my father...
- Even that was business, not personal.

94
00:13:39,720 --> 00:13:43,156
Then business will have to suffer.
Do me a favour.

95
00:13:43,360 --> 00:13:47,797
No more advice on how to
patch things up. Just help me win.

96
00:13:53,240 --> 00:13:56,835
I found out about Captain McCluskey,
who broke Mike's jaw.

97
00:13:57,040 --> 00:14:01,113
He's definitely on Sollozzo's payroll,
and for big money.

98
00:14:01,320 --> 00:14:04,995
McCluskey has agreed to be
The Turk's bodyguard.

99
00:14:05,200 --> 00:14:08,670
So when Sollozzo is being guarded,
he's invulnerable.

100
00:14:08,880 --> 00:14:12,316
Nobody has ever gunned down
a New York police captain.

101
00:14:12,520 --> 00:14:18,038
All the families would come after you.
The Corleone family would be outcasts!

102
00:14:18,240 --> 00:14:21,869
Even the old man's political protection
would run for cover.

103
00:14:23,120 --> 00:14:27,272
Do me a favour.
Take this into consideration.

104
00:14:30,600 --> 00:14:32,750
All right, we'll wait.

105
00:14:37,320 --> 00:14:40,596
We can't wait. We can't wait.

106
00:14:41,560 --> 00:14:45,314
No matter what Sollozzo says,
he's going to kill Pop.

107
00:14:45,520 --> 00:14:49,149
That's the key for him.
We've got to get Sollozzo.

108
00:14:49,360 --> 00:14:53,319
- Mike is right.
- Let me ask you something.

109
00:14:53,520 --> 00:14:58,116
What about this McCluskey?
What do we do with this cop?

110
00:15:02,760 --> 00:15:06,036
They want to have a meeting
with me, right?

111
00:15:06,240 --> 00:15:10,950
It will be me, McCluskey and Sollozzo.

112
00:15:12,520 --> 00:15:15,034
Let's set the meeting.

113
00:15:16,480 --> 00:15:20,439
Get our informers to find out
where it's going to be held.

114
00:15:21,840 --> 00:15:25,515
We insist it's a public place.
A bar, a restaurant.

115
00:15:25,720 --> 00:15:29,554
Some place where there are people,
so I feel safe.

116
00:15:31,720 --> 00:15:34,553
They'll search me when I meet them,
right?

117
00:15:34,760 --> 00:15:37,513
So I can't have a weapon on me.

118
00:15:40,240 --> 00:15:45,439
But if Clemenza can figure out a way to
have a weapon planted there for me...

119
00:15:49,800 --> 00:15:52,439
...then I'll kill them both.

120
00:16:03,640 --> 00:16:08,156
Nice college boy. Didn't want to
get mixed up in the family business.

121
00:16:08,360 --> 00:16:11,750
Now you want to shoot a police captain
because he slapped you?

122
00:16:11,960 --> 00:16:18,115
This isn't like the army! You have to get
close and get their brains on your suit.

123
00:16:18,320 --> 00:16:20,959
You're taking this very personal.

124
00:16:21,160 --> 00:16:24,357
Tom, this is business
and he's taking it personal.

125
00:16:24,560 --> 00:16:28,155
- Where does it say you can't kill a cop?
- Mikey...

126
00:16:28,360 --> 00:16:34,549
I'm talking about a cop who's mixed up
in drugs, a dishonest cop.

127
00:16:34,760 --> 00:16:38,594
A cop who got mixed up in the rackets
and got what was coming.

128
00:16:38,800 --> 00:16:43,954
That's a terrific story. We have
newspaper people on the payroll, right?

129
00:16:44,760 --> 00:16:48,639
- They might like a story like that.
- They might.

130
00:16:51,880 --> 00:16:55,589
It's not personal, Sonny.
It's strictly business.

131
00:16:58,320 --> 00:17:03,269
It's as cold as they come. Impossible to
trace, so you don't worry about prints.

132
00:17:03,480 --> 00:17:07,917
I put a special tape on the trigger
and the butt. Try it.

133
00:17:19,040 --> 00:17:21,679
Is the trigger too tight?

134
00:17:24,360 --> 00:17:25,634
My ears!

135
00:17:25,840 --> 00:17:31,039
I left it noisy, so it scares away any
pain-in-the-ass innocent bystanders.

136
00:17:31,240 --> 00:17:34,232
You've shot them both.
Now what do you do?

137
00:17:35,800 --> 00:17:39,588
- Sit down, finish my dinner.
- Don't fool around.

138
00:17:39,800 --> 00:17:43,110
Let your hand drop to your side
and let the gun slip out.

139
00:17:43,320 --> 00:17:47,359
Everybody will still think you've got it.
They'll stare at your face,

140
00:17:47,560 --> 00:17:50,279
so walk out fast, but don't run.

141
00:17:50,480 --> 00:17:53,756
Don't look anybody in the eye,
but don't look away either.

142
00:17:53,960 --> 00:17:57,111
They'll be scared stiff,
so don't worry about nothing.

143
00:17:59,120 --> 00:18:03,159
You'll be all right. You'll take a vacation,
nobody knows where,

144
00:18:03,360 --> 00:18:05,715
and we'll catch the hell.

145
00:18:05,920 --> 00:18:09,469
- How bad do you think it will be?
- Pretty goddamn bad.

146
00:18:09,680 --> 00:18:13,150
All the other families will probably
line up against us.

147
00:18:13,360 --> 00:18:18,150
These things have to happen every five,
ten years. Gets rid of the bad blood.

148
00:18:18,360 --> 00:18:22,353
Been ten years since the last one.
You have to stop them at the beginning.

149
00:18:22,560 --> 00:18:28,430
Like they should have stopped Hitler in
Munich, not letting him get away with it.

150
00:18:29,200 --> 00:18:33,432
You know, Mike, we were all proud
of you. Being a hero and all.

151
00:18:33,640 --> 00:18:36,029
Your father too.

152
00:19:11,720 --> 00:19:15,110
Nothing. Not a hint. Absolutely nothing.

153
00:19:16,040 --> 00:19:20,113
Even Sollozzo's people don't know
where the meeting will be held.

154
00:19:20,320 --> 00:19:23,073
How much time do we have?

155
00:19:23,280 --> 00:19:28,229
They're going to pick you up outside
Jack Dempsey's in an hour and a half.

156
00:19:28,760 --> 00:19:34,278
- We could put a tail on them.
- Sollozzo would lose our ass.

157
00:19:34,800 --> 00:19:39,191
- What about the negotiator?
- He's playing pinochle with my men.

158
00:19:39,400 --> 00:19:44,269
- He's happy. They're letting him win.
- Too risky. Maybe we should call it off.

159
00:19:44,480 --> 00:19:47,790
The negotiator plays cards
until Mike is back safe.

160
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:51,470
- He could blast whoever is in the car.
- They'll expect that.

161
00:19:51,680 --> 00:19:54,797
Sollozzo might not even be
in the car, Sonny!

162
00:19:55,000 --> 00:19:57,036
I'll get it.

163
00:20:20,480 --> 00:20:22,471
Louis' restaurant in the Bronx.

164
00:20:22,680 --> 00:20:25,672
- Is it reliable?
- My man in McCluskey's precinct.

165
00:20:25,880 --> 00:20:31,398
A police captain is on call <i>2</i>4 hours
a day. He'll be there between 8 and 10.

166
00:20:31,600 --> 00:20:36,230
- Anybody know this joint?
- Sure, I do. It's perfect for us.

167
00:20:36,440 --> 00:20:41,230
A small family place, good food.
Everyone minds his business. Perfect.

168
00:20:41,440 --> 00:20:47,231
They've got an old-fashioned toilet.
You know, the box and the chain thing.

169
00:20:48,600 --> 00:20:51,194
We might be able to tape the gun
behind it.

170
00:20:51,400 --> 00:20:55,757
All right. Mike, you go to the restaurant,

171
00:20:55,960 --> 00:20:59,635
you eat, talk for a while, you relax.
Make them relax.

172
00:20:59,840 --> 00:21:04,630
Then you go to take a leak. No, better
still, you ask permission to go.

173
00:21:04,840 --> 00:21:09,356
Then you come back blasting.
Two shots in the head apiece.

174
00:21:09,560 --> 00:21:13,189
I want somebody very good
to plant that gun.

175
00:21:13,400 --> 00:21:16,278
I don't want him coming out
with just his dick.

176
00:21:16,480 --> 00:21:21,918
- The gun will be there.
- You drive him and pick him up.

177
00:21:22,120 --> 00:21:24,509
Let's move.

178
00:21:28,960 --> 00:21:31,918
Did he tell you to drop the gun
right away?

179
00:21:32,120 --> 00:21:34,270
Yeah, a million times.

180
00:21:38,240 --> 00:21:43,189
Don't forget. Two shots apiece in
the head as soon as you come out.

181
00:21:48,680 --> 00:21:52,639
How long do you think it will be
before I can come back?

182
00:21:52,840 --> 00:21:55,070
At least a year.

183
00:21:55,280 --> 00:22:00,229
I'll square it with Mom, that you're not
seeing her before you leave and...

184
00:22:01,120 --> 00:22:04,715
I'll get a message to that girlfriend
when the time is right.

185
00:22:10,480 --> 00:22:12,630
Take care.

186
00:22:14,760 --> 00:22:16,910
Take care, Mike.

187
00:22:47,600 --> 00:22:51,593
I'm glad you came. I hope we can
straighten everything out.

188
00:22:52,640 --> 00:22:57,191
It's not the way I wanted things to go.
It should never have happened.

189
00:22:57,400 --> 00:23:01,678
I want to straighten everything out.
I don't want my father bothered again.

190
00:23:01,880 --> 00:23:05,668
I swear on my children
that he won't be, Mike.

191
00:23:05,880 --> 00:23:08,997
But you have to keep an open mind
when we talk.

192
00:23:09,200 --> 00:23:14,513
I hope you're not a hothead like Sonny.
You can't talk business with him.

193
00:23:14,720 --> 00:23:17,029
He's a good kid.

194
00:23:20,520 --> 00:23:23,876
I'm sorry about the other night, Mike.

195
00:23:24,080 --> 00:23:29,029
I've got to frisk you, so turn around.
On your knees, facing me.

196
00:23:32,760 --> 00:23:37,629
I guess I'm getting too old for my job.
Too grouchy.

197
00:23:38,520 --> 00:23:42,399
Can't stand the aggravation.
You know how it is.

198
00:23:44,440 --> 00:23:47,193
He's clean.

199
00:24:11,440 --> 00:24:13,715
Going to Jersey?

200
00:24:15,920 --> 00:24:18,309
Maybe.

201
00:24:41,680 --> 00:24:44,194
Nice work, Lou.

202
00:25:19,080 --> 00:25:24,279
- How's the food in this restaurant?
- Try the veal. It's the best in the city.

203
00:25:24,480 --> 00:25:26,914
I'll have it.

204
00:26:00,120 --> 00:26:03,476
- I'm going to speak Italian to Mikey.
- Go ahead.

205
00:27:19,440 --> 00:27:22,000
What I want...

206
00:27:22,200 --> 00:27:24,634
What's most important to me...

207
00:27:26,760 --> 00:27:30,992
...is that I have a guarantee.
No more attempts on my father's life.

208
00:27:31,200 --> 00:27:35,159
What guarantees can I give you?
I'm the hunted one!

209
00:27:35,360 --> 00:27:38,670
I missed my chance.
You think too much of me, kid.

210
00:27:38,880 --> 00:27:40,996
I'm not that clever.

211
00:27:42,240 --> 00:27:44,595
All I want is a truce.

212
00:27:50,760 --> 00:27:54,469
I have to go to the bathroom.
Is it all right?

213
00:27:55,680 --> 00:27:58,752
When you got to go, you got to go.

214
00:28:03,520 --> 00:28:04,999
He's clean.

215
00:28:05,200 --> 00:28:07,998
Don't take too long.

216
00:28:10,320 --> 00:28:12,276
I've frisked a thousand punks.

217
00:32:50,880 --> 00:32:53,030
Okay, you take over.

218
00:33:09,320 --> 00:33:12,198
I love you, Grandpa.

219
00:33:13,680 --> 00:33:16,911
I'm sorry, Pa. He doesn't know you yet.

220
00:33:17,680 --> 00:33:20,638
- Hey, big guy. Give it to Grandpa.
- Okay.

221
00:33:20,840 --> 00:33:26,790
"I hope you get well, Grandpa, and wish
I see you soon. Your grandson Frank."

222
00:33:29,840 --> 00:33:31,876
Go with your mother.

223
00:33:32,080 --> 00:33:34,435
Take them downstairs.

224
00:33:39,920 --> 00:33:42,309
Go on, Carlo, you too.

225
00:33:43,480 --> 00:33:45,118
Go on.

226
00:34:04,600 --> 00:34:08,559
- What's the matter with you, Carlo?
- Shut up and set the table.

227
00:34:23,520 --> 00:34:29,629
Since McCluskey's killing, the police
have cracked down on our operations.

228
00:34:31,000 --> 00:34:35,835
And also the other families.
There's been a lot of bad blood.

229
00:34:36,040 --> 00:34:39,316
They hit us, so we hit them back.

230
00:34:39,800 --> 00:34:44,191
Through our newspaper contacts
we've been able to put out material

231
00:34:44,400 --> 00:34:48,473
about McCluskey's link with Sollozzo
in the drug rackets.

232
00:34:48,680 --> 00:34:50,750
So things are loosening up.

233
00:34:51,720 --> 00:34:59,035
And I sent Fredo to Las Vegas, under
the protection of Don Francesco of L.A.

234
00:34:59,240 --> 00:35:04,758
- I want him to rest.
- I'm going to learn the casino business.

235
00:35:10,760 --> 00:35:12,716
Where's Michael?

236
00:35:24,720 --> 00:35:27,518
It was Michael who killed Sollozzo.

237
00:35:29,560 --> 00:35:33,758
But he's safe. We're starting to work
to bring him back.

238
00:35:53,920 --> 00:35:58,357
Did you find out where that old pimp
Tattaglia is hiding? I want him now.

239
00:35:58,560 --> 00:36:01,518
Sonny, things are starting to loosen up.

240
00:36:01,720 --> 00:36:06,316
If you go after Tattaglia, all hell
will break loose. Pop can negotiate.

241
00:36:06,520 --> 00:36:12,038
- He must get better first. I'll decide...
- War is costly. We can't do business.

242
00:36:12,240 --> 00:36:15,915
- Neither can they. Don't worry about it!
- We can't afford a stalemate.

243
00:36:16,120 --> 00:36:20,875
- No more stalemate. I'll kill the bastard!
- You're getting a great reputation!

244
00:36:21,080 --> 00:36:26,518
Do as I say! If I had a Sicilian wartime
<i>consigliere,</i> I wouldn't be in this shape!

245
00:36:26,720 --> 00:36:29,678
Pop had Genco. Look what I got.

246
00:36:32,040 --> 00:36:34,474
I'm sorry. I didn't mean that.

247
00:36:35,560 --> 00:36:38,597
Ma made a little dinner. It's Sunday.

248
00:36:39,200 --> 00:36:43,512
Niggers are having a good time
with our policy banks in Harlem.

249
00:36:43,720 --> 00:36:47,474
Driving new Cadillacs,
paying 50 per cent on a bet.

250
00:36:47,680 --> 00:36:50,638
That's because they've started
making big money.

251
00:36:50,840 --> 00:36:54,116
Poppa never talked business
at the table.

252
00:36:54,320 --> 00:36:58,598
- Shut up, Connie...
- Don't you ever tell her to shut up.

253
00:36:58,800 --> 00:37:01,519
Don't interfere.

254
00:37:01,720 --> 00:37:05,679
I'd like to talk to you after dinner.
I could do more for the family...

255
00:37:05,880 --> 00:37:08,599
We don't discuss business at the table.

256
00:37:53,720 --> 00:37:56,359
I kiss your hand, Don Tommasino.

257
00:38:01,960 --> 00:38:03,871
Why are you so far
from the house?

258
00:38:04,080 --> 00:38:06,719
You know I'm responsible to your
father for your life.

259
00:38:06,920 --> 00:38:08,911
The bodyguards are here.

260
00:38:09,120 --> 00:38:11,350
It's still dangerous...

261
00:38:11,560 --> 00:38:14,120
We've heard from Santino
in New York...

262
00:38:14,320 --> 00:38:17,437
Your enemies know you're here.

263
00:38:17,640 --> 00:38:20,712
Did Santino say when
I can go back?

264
00:38:20,920 --> 00:38:22,512
Not yet.

265
00:38:22,720 --> 00:38:25,473
It's out of the question.

266
00:38:28,240 --> 00:38:30,515
Where are you going now?

267
00:38:32,520 --> 00:38:34,988
Take my car.

268
00:38:36,280 --> 00:38:38,714
I want to walk.

269
00:38:40,520 --> 00:38:41,953
Be careful.

270
00:39:14,520 --> 00:39:16,112
Where have all the men gone?

271
00:39:16,320 --> 00:39:19,073
They're all dead from vendettas.

272
00:39:20,080 --> 00:39:23,117
There are the names of the dead.

273
00:39:38,480 --> 00:39:42,029
Hey, hey, take me to the America, G.I.!

274
00:39:42,280 --> 00:39:45,829
Hey, hey, take me to the America, G.I.!
Clark Gable!

275
00:39:46,560 --> 00:39:51,873
America! Take me to the America, G.I.!
Clark Gable, Rita Hayworth!

276
00:40:09,080 --> 00:40:11,355
Mamma mia what a beauty.

277
00:40:19,680 --> 00:40:22,114
I think you got hit
by the thunderbolt.

278
00:40:28,120 --> 00:40:31,908
In Sicily women are more
dangerous than shotguns.

279
00:40:54,080 --> 00:40:56,150
Did you have a good hunt?

280
00:40:56,360 --> 00:40:58,828
You know all the girls
around here?

281
00:40:59,040 --> 00:41:01,474
We saw some real beauties.

282
00:41:01,680 --> 00:41:05,639
One of them struck our friend
like a thunderbolt.

283
00:41:07,960 --> 00:41:10,713
She would tempt the devil himself.

284
00:41:18,040 --> 00:41:20,474
Really put together.

285
00:41:24,560 --> 00:41:26,755
Such hair, such mouth!

286
00:41:28,760 --> 00:41:32,116
The girls around here are
beautiful... but virtuous.

287
00:41:32,320 --> 00:41:34,709
This one had a purple dress...

288
00:41:34,920 --> 00:41:37,354
And a purple ribbon in her hair.

289
00:41:37,560 --> 00:41:41,553
A type more Greek than Italian.

290
00:41:43,400 --> 00:41:45,356
Do you know her?

291
00:41:49,120 --> 00:41:52,112
There's no girl like that
in this town.

292
00:41:54,440 --> 00:41:56,715
My God, I understand!

293
00:41:59,720 --> 00:42:02,029
What's wrong?

294
00:42:03,320 --> 00:42:04,878
Let's go.

295
00:42:06,040 --> 00:42:07,393
It's his daughter.

296
00:42:07,600 --> 00:42:09,909
Tell him to come here.

297
00:42:11,760 --> 00:42:13,557
Call him.

298
00:42:32,760 --> 00:42:35,320
Fabrizio, you translate.

299
00:42:38,680 --> 00:42:41,638
I apologise if I offended you.

300
00:42:41,840 --> 00:42:44,673
I'm a stranger in this country.

301
00:42:44,880 --> 00:42:48,156
I meant no disrespect
to you or your daughter.

302
00:42:53,240 --> 00:42:55,754
I'm an American, hiding in Sicily.

303
00:42:57,160 --> 00:42:59,879
My name is Michael Corleone.

304
00:43:01,360 --> 00:43:05,319
There are people who'd pay a lot
of money for that information.

305
00:43:07,280 --> 00:43:10,556
But then your daughter
would lose a father...

306
00:43:11,880 --> 00:43:14,599
...instead of gaining a husband.

307
00:43:21,880 --> 00:43:24,633
I want to meet your daughter.

308
00:43:24,840 --> 00:43:29,231
With your permission, and under
the supervision of your family.

309
00:43:29,760 --> 00:43:32,513
With all respect.

310
00:43:37,560 --> 00:43:41,519
Come to my house Sunday morning.
My name is Vitelli.

311
00:43:47,160 --> 00:43:49,116
What's her name?

312
00:46:35,920 --> 00:46:38,388
I'll knock you dizzy.

313
00:46:43,520 --> 00:46:45,829
Save it for the library.

314
00:46:49,080 --> 00:46:51,753
We've got to pick up my sister.

315
00:47:08,880 --> 00:47:11,394
What's the matter?

316
00:47:12,960 --> 00:47:14,598
What's the matter?

317
00:47:16,280 --> 00:47:18,669
- It was my fault!
- Where is he?

318
00:47:18,880 --> 00:47:21,519
It was my fault. I hit him.

319
00:47:21,720 --> 00:47:26,077
I started a fight with him.
I hit him, so he hit me...

320
00:47:29,440 --> 00:47:33,149
I'm just going to get a doctor
to take a look at you.

321
00:47:33,360 --> 00:47:36,318
Sonny, please don't do anything.

322
00:47:36,520 --> 00:47:39,478
What's the matter with you?
What am I going to do?

323
00:47:39,680 --> 00:47:42,478
Make that baby an orphan
before he's born?

324
00:47:46,720 --> 00:47:49,598
You spic slobs still betting Yankees?

325
00:47:49,800 --> 00:47:52,997
Tell them to stop taking in action.

326
00:47:53,200 --> 00:47:55,156
We lost enough money last week.

327
00:48:01,720 --> 00:48:03,756
Come here, come here!

328
00:48:58,280 --> 00:49:01,352
If you touch my sister again, I'll kill you.

329
00:52:45,160 --> 00:52:49,119
Hey! We weren't expecting you, Kay.
You should call.

330
00:52:49,320 --> 00:52:53,313
Yes, I have. I've tried writing and calling.

331
00:52:53,520 --> 00:52:57,115
- I want to reach Michael.
- Nobody knows where he is.

332
00:52:57,320 --> 00:53:00,278
All we know is that he's all right.

333
00:53:02,040 --> 00:53:05,999
- What was that?
- An accident, but nobody was hurt.

334
00:53:07,040 --> 00:53:11,989
Tom, will you give this letter to Michael.
Please?

335
00:53:12,240 --> 00:53:17,473
If I accepted that, a court could prove
I have knowledge of his whereabouts.

336
00:53:17,680 --> 00:53:19,875
He'll get in touch with you.

337
00:53:20,080 --> 00:53:23,470
I let my cab go, so can I call
another one, please?

338
00:53:23,680 --> 00:53:25,636
Come on. Sorry.

339
00:53:44,080 --> 00:53:47,038
- Hello?
- <i>Is Carlo there?</i>

340
00:53:47,240 --> 00:53:49,470
- Who is this?
- <i>A friend of Carlo.</i>

341
00:53:49,680 --> 00:53:53,116
<i>Tell him that I can't make it tonight</i>
<i>until later.</i>

342
00:53:58,440 --> 00:54:00,237
Bitch!

343
00:54:01,920 --> 00:54:04,275
- Dinner's on the table.
- I'm not hungry.

344
00:54:04,480 --> 00:54:07,472
- The food is getting cold.
- I'll eat out later.

345
00:54:07,680 --> 00:54:09,955
You just told me to make you dinner!

346
00:54:17,960 --> 00:54:20,679
She has a filthy mouth, this Guinea brat.

347
00:54:24,760 --> 00:54:28,719
That's it, break it all, you spoiled
Guinea brat. Break it all!

348
00:54:37,600 --> 00:54:41,070
Why don't you bring your whore
home for dinner?

349
00:54:41,680 --> 00:54:44,433
Maybe I will.

350
00:54:49,480 --> 00:54:52,438
- Clean it up!
- Like hell I will!

351
00:54:52,640 --> 00:54:56,679
You skinny, spoiled brat.
Clean it up! Clean it up!

352
00:54:56,880 --> 00:55:00,555
Clean it up! I said, clean it up!
Clean it up!

353
00:55:03,040 --> 00:55:06,191
Clean it up. Clean that up, you...

354
00:55:08,680 --> 00:55:10,477
Clean it!

355
00:55:10,680 --> 00:55:14,639
Clean it up! Yeah, kill me.
Be a murderer, like your father!

356
00:55:14,840 --> 00:55:18,116
- All you Corleones are murderers!
- I hate you!

357
00:55:18,320 --> 00:55:21,039
Come on, kill me!

358
00:55:21,240 --> 00:55:22,832
Get out of here!

359
00:55:23,040 --> 00:55:26,112
- I hate you!
- Now I'll kill you.

360
00:55:26,320 --> 00:55:29,278
You Guinea brat. Get out of here!

361
00:55:38,840 --> 00:55:42,230
Connie, what's the matter?
I can't hear you.

362
00:55:42,800 --> 00:55:45,678
Connie, talk louder. The baby's crying.

363
00:55:45,880 --> 00:55:49,236
Santino, I can't understand.
I don't know.

364
00:55:49,840 --> 00:55:52,115
Yeah, Connie.

365
00:55:56,360 --> 00:55:58,316
You wait there.

366
00:56:00,520 --> 00:56:02,954
No, you just wait there.

367
00:56:05,080 --> 00:56:07,389
Son-of-a-bitch.

368
00:56:07,600 --> 00:56:10,512
- Son-of-a-bitch!
- What's the matter?

369
00:56:14,160 --> 00:56:17,596
Open the goddamn gate!
Get off your ass.

370
00:56:24,840 --> 00:56:26,432
Sonny!

371
00:56:32,320 --> 00:56:34,880
- Sonny.
- Get out of here!

372
00:56:35,240 --> 00:56:37,276
Go after him, go on!

373
00:57:05,480 --> 00:57:08,950
Son-of-a-bitch. Come on!
